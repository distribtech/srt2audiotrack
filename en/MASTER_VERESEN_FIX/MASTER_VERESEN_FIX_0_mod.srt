1
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:07,820
One, two...

2
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:14,581
Are you from Lviv? Yes.

3
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,799
We`re brothers, and here brother said...

4
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:27,656
Vasya, this Malevich isn`t cool,
and this fool says that he is good.

5
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:32,000
When Tkachenko left, I led at TSN for a couple of months.

6
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh my God, we don't have a prime minister.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,560
On the 5th day she said, couldn't you kick him?

8
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:41,609
Slap him in the face.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,000
On the 10th day, well, not so much, just a little,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,011
why are you slapping him in the face like that?

11
00:00:49,562 --> 00:01:00,349
As long as you don't have 100,000 on the
Maidan, we won't do anything.

12
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:03,114
Everyone was on time.

13
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,884
Even Yanukovych was on time.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In Ukraine, if you gave money, you are a good boy.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,393
Again, such an age, such a disease, this age.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,750
Let's do it like in Moscow,
everything is fine there.

17
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:24,603
He came and said, like this, you will act as I say,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,372
and that's it.

19
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:31,374
I would say that this Zelenskyy and
Zaluzhnyi is a very simple story.

20
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:35,000
Someone doesn't want Putin to die...

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,202
Lady of Lviv, Yaffarion.

22
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:44,710
Here is such a subtle moment.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,829
What do you want?

24
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,433
Hey, you assholes!

25
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:54,000
Why the hell are you talking in Russian?

26
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,018
Yermak is terrible.

27
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:02,000
I will shoot myself in front of your eyes
for the sake of the victory of Ukraine.

28
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,000
What is this content?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let me smear the f**king spirituality.

30
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:12,394
Only I will personally give you
a gun so that you kill them.

31
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:18,844
Mykola Veresen, the meter of Ukrainian
television and Ukrainian journalism.

32
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:22,663
Today we have a conversation from the 
appropriate to the taboo.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And, by the way, not a meter,
but a meter and seventy-eight.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I would like to clarify this.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,639
Watch on the YouTube channel of Natalia Moseichuk, Mykola Veresen.

36
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:39,758
Moseychuk + He`s called Mykola Veresen.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You sat? Hi.

38
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:46,968
This means the beginning,
we usually do this.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know, I have some experience in TV.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Not a big one, but... A little.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Especially with this director.

42
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,000
Clear.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And with the director, yes.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,457
Not much has changed.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well, it has changed and it has not changed.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't say so clearly.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All these are conditions.

48
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:09,000
Both phrases are correct.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,474
People do not change and people change.

50
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:13,000
Both of these phrases are correct.

51
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,552
They do not change and they change.

52
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:17,664
Television does not change and it changes.

53
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,730
Ukraine does not change and it changes.

54
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:24,554
Here... It will not change... You
can't say so accurately and determine.

55
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,579
Only your phrase does not change.

56
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,000
How do you start the broadcast?

57
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,000
I`m called Mykola Veresen.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes, yes.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's the name.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,814
It's true.

61
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,000
That's the name.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you that we were able
to get you out of Lviv.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes, this is God.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is not me.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is no one.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,727
This is some kind of divine idea.

67
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:45,000
Because I really had to come to Kyiv.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I had things to do here.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And they called me here.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,633
And I thought, well, if I'm already here, then why won't I come?

71
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:52,633
I never refuse.

72
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,000
Because I don't like it when 
they refuse me.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,395
Because I have such a profession as you do.

74
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,000
And it's obvious that when you consider something,

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and then a person runs away at
the last moment, it's very unpleasant.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I know what it's like so I never refuse.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because, well, what?

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,397
If I had been in your place

80
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,000
and invited you, and you hadn't come at the last moment,

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,055
what would I have done?

82
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,000
I understand it.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,618
I had such an attitude yesterday
when one person refused me.

84
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,213
And I was a little disappointed.

85
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,532
But I also want to say thank you to Den Borysovich Yanevsky.

86
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:30,724
Because he, sitting here in your place a
week ago, remembered how you, in 1991,

87
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:37,000
having, it seems, 20 dollars in your
pocket, paid for a car and went to Belarus.

88
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:41,000
And, in fact, today it is also the subject of our study with you.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,766
Because you are a person who saw the
independence for 33 years and a little earlier.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And you have something to tell.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And I am interested in this, because all these
memories of people who sit in this chair,

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
they are very subjective,
but they are very fragmentary.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,417
And the story consists of these fragments.

94
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:05,893
Because the views on it can be different.

95
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,000
But this is a testimony.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,146
And I listened to you when you
said that people think in every way,

97
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:17,000
but you call for tolerance,
not Facebook emotions.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,704
I am the same with my viewers.

99
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:24,350
I say, try to understand a person who has
seen these circumstances in this way.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And, probably, from 1991
and we will start... From 1989.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,338
Do we have to start from 1989?

102
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:33,363
Well, yes.

103
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:37,752
At the BBC, I even remember, on August 16, 1989,

104
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:39,681
my voice sounded there for the first time.

105
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,659
That is, you are an inoagent speaking today's language.

106
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:43,684
I'm worse.

107
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,709
I didn't think about it.

108
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:50,734
In Russian, there is such a saying,
eyes are afraid, hands are doing.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I had the same thing.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I was already somewhere at the end
of the 90s, at the beginning of the 00s,

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I looked into the Penal Code of the Ukrainian SSR.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There was no Penal Code of the USSR.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What could be with me, right?

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,219
Each republic had its own Penal Code.

115
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:14,841
I found, there is an article about the betrayal
of the homeland in the form of espionage.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,363
The main basis of it, it is to get a gain.

117
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:22,419
And since I worked at the BBC and received a gain,

118
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:25,444
I betrayed my homeland in the form of espionage.

119
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,000
15 years or shooting.

120
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:29,663
Cool.

121
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,975
So... Mr. Mykola, you
found a job for yourself.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I just didn't know.

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Maybe if I had read it then, if
someone had suggested the Penal Code,

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I might have said, no, no, no,
let's not do it.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,515
And what did the work at the BBC look like? Tell me.

126
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:43,808
Well, how?

127
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,833
In 1989.

128
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:48,561
In 1989 it was...
Well, it was a disaster.

129
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:53,450
Because you didn't even... Well, first
of all, I'll tell you subjectively.

130
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:58,271
My first half of the year, I
don't have much time, once a month,

131
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:00,000
two times a month, maybe three times a month

132
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:05,000
my temperature jumped to
40 degrees for one hour.

133
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:11,000
After an hour, it dropped again to 36.6.

134
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,000
And then I kept living.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then there was the report again.

136
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:23,164
And then it was... Well, it wasn't
now, I pressed, you called, and that's it.

137
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,286
And then I had to order.

138
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,311
So, tell me, there was no office, right?

139
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:28,469
Well, I don't remember.

140
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:29,494
People think it's an office.

141
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,000
073 or 079.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You call 073 or 079.

143
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:35,526
I still remember.

144
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:39,000
And you say, the girl is from Smolny, but
not from Smolny, the girl is from London.

145
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:42,000
Obviously, a major is sitting next to the girl.

146
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:46,000
And he is recording all the people who are calling in London.

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And when one calls the BBC,
it's obvious that he is not only signaling.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, I was then shown by the mayor of Odesa, Gurvits.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He laughed a lot.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We met in the Verkhovna Rada.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He showed me... So, there
was already independence,

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but top officials received on
the table the interception of the radio voices.

153
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:16,000
And he showed me, like, the enemy of the people.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Here is Veresen, here is such
a... And there was also the word 'secrecy.'

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What did you say in London?

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Everything that could be listened to.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It was very funny, because you could listen,

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,409
and the next morning you could look at yourself at the table.

159
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,000
The same thing as yesterday.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,329
Yesterday, as a normal citizen, you could
catch the BBC frequency if it wasn't muted.

161
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,395
And listen to it.

162
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,203
And Shcherbitsky got it on the table in the morning.

163
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:43,436
Printed one.

164
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,269
And why did the choice fall on you?

165
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,174
Nobody wanted to work.

166
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, who wants to go to prison?

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Who wants to go to Siberia?

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Nobody wants to.

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,589
It's just Veresen, idiot.

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's why I got there myself.

171
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:04,000
And that's why somehow they... Well,
there are no such people there anymore.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,416
Those were old times.

173
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,553
It was such a classic BBC, Russian service.

174
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,000
Well, there were no others then.

175
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:14,000
Then the Ukrainian one appeared.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And when Techer came here, Chornovyl
asked her why there was no Ukrainian.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,341
And she said, well, we can't.

178
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,000
How many languages do we have
on the territory of the Soviet Union?

179
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,000
Only 15 languages of the republic.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,162
There is also autonomy.

181
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:32,000
She says we don't have such a budget.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We can't speak every language.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, that's a lot of money.

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It all costs a lot of money.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And so there was a Russian
service, a classic one.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And they treated me very well
because I think they didn't understand

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
why the hell I needed it.

188
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,607
A spy in Ukraine.

189
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,000
A spy in Ukraine.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, I was lucky today because
Veresen came in February.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And why did Veresen appear, in principle?

193
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:10,409
Oh, it's so delusional... It's so... As I tell you
now, it's not far from here, by the way.

194
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:12,433
It's quite close to the madhouse.

195
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,496
A car will come after me from the madhouse.

196
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:18,000
So, I wasn't a dissident.

197
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,554
But I worked at the BBC.

198
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,000
And among the dissidents, they
investigated me for a very long time.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,451
Well, those who were already...
Well, you were even the opposite.

200
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:28,000
You were from an elite club.

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No, my father was a member of
the Central Committee.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He was the head of the Verkhovna Rada at the time.

203
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:35,245
Well, this is such a nominal position.

204
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,000
Now the head of the Verkhovna Rada is something.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And then it was just...
Well, gilded youth.

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
One way or another.

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Gilded youth.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, among gilded youth, there
was gold, there was diamond,

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and there was bad.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,646
Really?

211
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:55,457
Because it didn't always correspond...
Your behavior didn't always correspond...

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For example, if you study international relations,

213
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:03,519
international law, international
relations, then this is gold, really.

214
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,735
Petro Oleksievich is gold.

215
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Yes.

216
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:08,785
And there, well, all
these people... And you?

217
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,975
All these people, they... They went to
restaurants, they lived so luxuriously.

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,665
We didn't go to restaurants because I didn't have any money.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And so it is believed that those who were there,

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
we also looked at them, they were all like that.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They dressed up... Like people.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes, and so on.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I entered the Faculty of History because they had refused me.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,369
I wanted to study international relations, but
academician Shlipakov, Arnold Nikolayevich,

225
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:45,000
the main internationalist of Ukraine,

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,770
director of the Institute of
International Relations and World Economics,

227
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:55,421
he was there, now he is gone.

228
00:11:56,396 --> 00:12:02,104
My father called him, we met, and
he said, listen, this is not a profession.

229
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:05,436
International... This is
something international.

230
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,650
Go to the history department.

231
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,675
And I went to the history department.

232
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:17,700
And so I, in August... Well, I can
tell you, this is an interesting story.

233
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:23,779
I am very responsible, despite the fact
that I do not look like a responsible person,

234
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,232
I have never looked like that.

235
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:29,888
But I always thought, well, how do I need
to... If I promised, what should I do?

236
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,975
And I married.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,866
And I had no money.

238
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:37,891
Well, I worked as a lecturer, for 105 rubles.

239
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,516
My wife got 110 rubles, by the way.

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Remembered.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
My father did not give me money.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, he almost did not give me money.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We had such a Calvinist family.

244
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,000
Such a Protestantism.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And so I was looking for a job.

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I was preparing students for universities, and so on.

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I wanted...
Not that I wanted...

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I thought so.

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And someone told me, there is an
opportunity to work on the Ukrainian radio.

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have already forgotten which one.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
On the international or on the Ukrainian.

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And you did not have a division?

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,794
So that you would be teachers of history, no?

254
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:16,611
There was no such thing?

255
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:17,929
No. So I was a lecturer.

256
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:18,954
Oh, you were.

257
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:21,566
I worked for 105 rubles. I was a lecturer.

258
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Well, that's not enough.

259
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:26,000
And besides that, I wanted something else.

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
School or university or institute?

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No.

262
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:32,175
It was a pedagogy school.

263
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:45,819
And I was thinking, how could I work
somewhere else for 30 rubles, for 10, for 20.

264
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,000
And here I had corruption.

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Here I had a case of corruption.

266
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:59,809
I started walking around important
people on the radio.

267
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,538
And one of the important
people told me that

268
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:05,927
his daughter does not
know whether she will enter

269
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,669
a pedagogical school.

270
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,565
And it was so very popular there.

271
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:15,240
The number of people in one place was some kind of terrible.

272
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:23,597
He says, if you help my daughter to
enter, then I will take you here.

273
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:28,340
Since I am a bad corruptionist, I went to

274
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,365
the headmaster and told him all this.

275
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,947
There is such a situation.

276
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,975
Then the headmaster came to me.

277
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:40,943
And told me not to panic, that the
girl knows school subjects well.

278
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:43,682
That is, no bribing was needed.

279
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:47,983
And I came to that boy and said, here it is, I did something.

280
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:52,468
And, of course, as always, the
Soviet Union has never changed,

281
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,719
and the modern Ukraine is also such that it
is possible to promise, but not to fulfill.

282
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,407
So no?

283
00:14:56,432 --> 00:15:06,000
And I go out in such a gloom from
Khreshchatyk 26, and there is such a girl Katya.

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,468
It was just such a strange time when

285
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:14,548
Gorbachev let for the first
time foreigners

286
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,316
into the territory of the Soviet Union.

287
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:18,894
Previously, if you did not have a goal,

288
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:24,538
a student, a tourist, a relative,
that is, just Vasya Pupkin ...

289
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:27,000
This is now the United States of America, roughly speaking.

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, no, anyone can be there, depending on
whether they will give you a visa or not.

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,708
And here you just couldn't say,
I'm going to the Soviet Union.

292
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:39,000
What will you do there?

293
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And I'll just come, settle in a hotel, I'll live there, and go to exhibitions.

294
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:52,627
Well, this Katya is walking around,
and I'm going in a gloomy mood,

295
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,662
and she says to me, why are you gloomy?

296
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,268
This is the first foreign English woman,

297
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,521
who was probably the
first in Kyiv, who just came,

298
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,272
rented an apartment, and started to live.

299
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:09,000
Well, as if now you could go to
Warsaw or London if you have a visa.

300
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,000
And I say, well, yes, and I tell her the whole story.

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
She says, listen, I used to work at
... At the BBC, the Russian service.

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,069
I looked at her as if she was mad, just like that.

303
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:24,548
Well, because the BBC is like God here,

304
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:26,975
and there is a little higher
than God, and there is the BBC.

305
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, the BBC is under the carpet, roughly speaking.

306
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Have you ever listened to the BBC?

307
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes, but this is also quality.

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,550
Well, there are no such analogs now.

309
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,833
And I just missed the buzz.

310
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,858
Well, something went off, so as to support me, I guess.

311
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:48,000
And so ... Half a year
or more has passed.

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,241
I was at my father's house.

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,019
My father had not been a deputy, but
he was a member of the Central Committee.

314
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:00,400
And then my wife calls me with a groaning voice.

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,790
And she says that Katya called.

316
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:08,000
I say, well, okay.

317
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,718
You don't understand, she didn't call from Kyiv.

318
00:17:11,774 --> 00:17:13,837
She called from London.

319
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,120
She called from the BBC.

320
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:18,039
And I didn't know anything.

321
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:19,964
She didn't say that she was from the BBC.

322
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:21,000
She only said later.

323
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,562
And I gave your phone, so wait.

324
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,000
Now, from London itself, from the BBC,
you will be called to your father's apartment.

325
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,360
And indeed, they called.

326
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:38,581
And so I took the phone and said, give me a
couple of hours, because I'm not at home.

327
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,000
I told my father.

328
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,293
My father says, well, just work, don't lie.

329
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:48,445
Since the BBC, after all, not everyone has a good attitude to it.

330
00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:52,000
And I, yes, for the first time, about Chornobyl.

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I was from Chornobyl.

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,317
By the way, in Chornobyl, indeed, with my father.

333
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, in those times, when there was still the red forest, all these.

334
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, I told him what I saw there.

335
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:11,548
And then, then there was such, in foreign radio stations.

336
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,400
They understood that they were
in Munchin, London, or in Washington.

337
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:21,068
And I'm here, so they didn't
want to ask the questions

338
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:23,975
that could put me in jail.

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They suddenly, and don't ask why either.

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Eyes are afraid, hands are doing.

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,948
At the end as always they asked,

342
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:39,000
maybe you wanted to say something
about what we didn't ask you.

343
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:42,000
Well, because I took the initiative myself.

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So that I said, seeing what the circumstances are around me.

345
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:49,975
KGB, not KGB.

346
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,622
And I suddenly, I don't know why.

347
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,000
Maybe for the same reason, I'm here.

348
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This is how the stars aligned.

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I say, you see, this is not a Chornobyl disaster.

350
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,000
This is a disaster of that system that came in 1917.

351
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:12,000
What the hell did I say that?

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,647
Did you say something like that with your mouth?

353
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:17,975
I explained why it all happened.

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
These are all consequences of previous events.

355
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, in short, then the body temperature rose to 40 degrees.

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,975
Then, my wife, as I remember now,
put on my head some rag with vinegar.

357
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,523
I started thinking about how to fool the KGB.

358
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,047
I decided that in September I will be Veresen.

359
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,667
And in October I will be Zhovten.

360
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,262
And in November I will be Lystopad.

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,685
And in December, regardless of what, I will be Hruden.

362
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:58,332
And the KGB, of course, will never find me.

363
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:01,491
Well, of course, such seasonality, such cunningness, how would they?

364
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:08,190
And on September 3, indeed, I wrote some text, read it.

365
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's 079, the girl, London, etc., etc., etc.

366
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Then you wait, and you don't know
when they will call you.

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,501
Until three o'clock.

368
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:22,975
And you couldn't go out.

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You had to stand or sit next to the
phone and wait until it all happened.

370
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,752
Then one report, the second, the third, the fourth.

371
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,000
I thought, well, why would change
the name to Zhovten?

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And I stayed as Veresen.

373
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Veresen.

374
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So there is nothing extraordinary.

375
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't have a birthday in September.

376
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There is nothing in common.

377
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,209
It just happened like that.

378
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:51,975
Well, look, meters are not born, I think so.

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Meters are made, and this
is such a hard work.

380
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,804
You have to break this wall.

381
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:02,829
If you were from an elite family, or you were
from a farm family or a labor family.

382
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:03,854
It's such a thing.

383
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,879
You have to go and work.

384
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:07,904
And here is 1991.

385
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,765
When I asked Den Borisovich, I said, where were you in 1991?

386
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,975
You know, people still can't realize
that there were a few journalists then.

387
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,488
Yes, yes, yes.

388
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:23,480
People think that it's like now, you know,
20 TV channels and about 5 thousand journalists.

389
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:24,975
A million, yes.

390
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, in the country.

391
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Not in the country, but in Kyiv.

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And people need to be explained.

393
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,496
Because you were chosen, and you remain chosen.

394
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:36,766
You are meters.

395
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,791
You are Ukrainian meters.

396
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:43,206
This is a question of what we should be proud of.

397
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:46,231
That we don't have a portrait of Ukraine and so on.

398
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:47,521
We have it all.

399
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:51,450
The only thing is that we don't show it very willingly.

400
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:53,475
And we don't praise our own.

401
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
And we never show it.

402
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,195
And we don't really like to talk about it.

403
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,127
Well, this is, as for me, the Ukrainian feature.

404
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,411
I listened to you, you also complained about it.

405
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:03,546
And very correct.

406
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:04,975
Not like me now.

407
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Demonstratively.

408
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And that's why I want to learn about 1991.

409
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,655
How it all started.

410
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,628
Because Den Borysovych
shouted out here, he said,

411
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:16,975
we have no state, I'll tell
you how the elections happened.

412
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'll tell you that he said such a trigger thing.

413
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,150
And there were even reactions to what he said.

414
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:32,000
I got messages from other people
who were participants of those historical days.

415
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
In the elections,

416
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,520
in the parliament, and then in the trip to Belarus, and so on.

417
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,000
And people are a little bit offended
because they think that Den Borysovych

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
exceeded the level of epitome.

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And I always say that everyone
 has their own point of view here,

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and we are assembling such a historical puzzle,

421
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,685
from different people, and now we will
assemble it for you to understand

422
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:01,228
who and how watched those events.

423
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:07,000
Who were you in 1991? You are
a correspondent, a BBC journalist, after all.

424
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes.

425
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You no longer work in a pedagogical school?

426
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,476
I left the pedagogical school in 1990.

427
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:18,746
You are a journalist.

428
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,841
I went there in 1990, and I went to
London in 1990,

429
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:31,906
thinking whether I should stay
or return.

430
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:35,271
I had a whole revolution in my head.

431
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,406
And for two months I was choosing.

432
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:44,176
I came back, and then the students just laid on the Maidan.

433
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,684
And I remember that there was a beautiful story.

434
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,264
I was still working in the pedagogical school.

435
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,000
And there was supposed to be a meeting in the Ukrainian House.

436
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,185
I don't know what it's called now. It's the Ukrainian House, isn't it?

437
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:58,883
Well, yes.

438
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:00,908
I'm sorry, then it was a museum of Lenin.

439
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,426
There was no Ukrainian House at that time.

440
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:03,990
There was no such phrase.

441
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,015
For such a phrase – Sybir.

442
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,979
The one they call the European Square.

443
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:09,249
The European Square.

444
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:15,572
The students of pedagogical
school and some veterans gathered there.

445
00:24:15,928 --> 00:24:18,520
I don't remember what occasion it was.

446
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:28,324
And on the Maidan, it's already there...

447
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:30,510
Today he posted a photo with Plyushch and Kravchuk back then.

448
00:24:30,754 --> 00:24:32,216
Yes, I remember it all.

449
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,241
When he was performing at the Tribune of the Verkhovna Rada.

450
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:43,680
They came, there was a hall in
Lenin's museum,

451
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:45,266
and there was a party leading something.

452
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,010
And they gave me a word.

453
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,597
It was their mistake.

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,796
And I went out to say something there.

455
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:57,359
Then I say, the only thing I didn't understand is why you are sitting here.

456
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,250
All say, what?

457
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:03,203
Well, Maidan is 200 meters away and there are students.

458
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,060
Why aren't you there, where the students are?

459
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:10,000
And they looked at me like that.

460
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,740
Well, those veterans of the Brownian
movement, they were somehow surprised.

461
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,192
There was such a magazine 'Ukraine.'

462
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:21,777
There was such a huge tab.

463
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,292
There was Maidan, the students, and it was written in large letters

464
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
'The First Pedagogical School is with you.'

465
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,000
So I'm a revolutionary, I would say.

466
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,783
Lenin, damn it, Vladimir Ilyich.

467
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,000
And you went to Belarus as who?

468
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,522
No, it was already later.

469
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:44,547
It was already after the real independence.

470
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:50,975
Because there is such a Vladimir Filenko,
and there are a few more of my old friends.

471
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,324
And we all together believe that the independence day is on December the 1st.

472
00:25:56,006 --> 00:26:01,380
Because on 24th, 360 people said that we were independent.

473
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:06,000
And then 91% of Ukrainians said that we were independent.

474
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And we didn't really believe that.

475
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,468
Because exactly half a
year before that, in March,

476
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:15,520
72% said that we were for the
preservation of the Soviet Union.

477
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:16,975
Renewed.

478
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,539
So there was ... No, well, something happened
to the people that they responded later.

479
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:24,566
Well, half a year is not... It doesn't matter.

480
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:26,698
And there were such prices.

481
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,296
There were such prices.

482
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,654
You say 20$ to Minsk.

483
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:41,360
So, from Donetsk to Kyiv in August costed 10$.

484
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:43,000
So why did you go there?

485
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,975
Then there was no Internet.

486
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:48,154
And everything was at the level of rumors.

487
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:54,358
And something happens in ... So, the
Ukrainians voted for the independence.

488
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:56,383
Complete shock.

489
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,408
Complete.

490
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:03,690
Moscow is just ...
And we are brothers.

491
00:27:03,715 --> 00:27:05,968
And here the brothers said ...

492
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And then the conversation begins that there is something there.

493
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Someone is flying to Minsk.

494
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
There is something there.

495
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And Yeltsin is in Minsk.

496
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Shushkevich is there.

497
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,817
And Kravchuk.

498
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And that's all.

499
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:28,359
And there was some kind of ...
Well, then there were always drinking sprees.

500
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:37,234
From the second of December, when
 they began to recognize the referendum,

501
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,626
the Poles, the Hungarians, which is strange now, and the Canadians.

502
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,010
This is what I remember.

503
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:47,870
I had a consul, a friend, Nestor Hayovsky.

504
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:50,557
And he was just
... We were sitting.

505
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:57,000
And the future wife of Yushchenko organized one
of the big events in Lybid, in the restaurant.

506
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
There were meetings of deputies and journalists.

507
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
There were five of them.

508
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Four.

509
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,191
And he was so ... I remember everyone
saying, Hayovsky is going, Hayovsky is going.

510
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:10,000
And we went out like that.

511
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And he walked by like that.

512
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:15,554
As there is recognition.

513
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And this was such a series of these events, to put it mildly.

514
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,697
And there was another one somewhere in the hotel Kyiv.

515
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,000
And they began to dig into it.

516
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, there were foreigners.

517
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,697
There was a lot of knowledge
through the Moscow Bureau,

518
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:36,000
through London, through
Washington, through Brussels.

519
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:39,000
And they say, listen, something is happening there.

520
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And we are like, what?

521
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And what?

522
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And how is it going there?

523
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The planes have already started to fly rarely.

524
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The trains don't work.

525
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, that's it.

526
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The Soviet Union is over.

527
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:50,245
Here.

528
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:51,809
And night.

529
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:53,405
Night.

530
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,297
And the Guardian comes.

531
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:58,139
Martha is with the Guardian.

532
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:01,513
Said that she ordered a taxi there.

533
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,376
I say, well, what?

534
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:04,401
Well, so let's go.

535
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:05,426
You are going?

536
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:06,451
I say, well, I'm going.

537
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:10,530
Then I understood why Belarus is the way it is today.

538
00:29:10,555 --> 00:29:11,555
Why?

539
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,640
Because there was a reconstruction in Moscow,
movement, as it is called in young slang.

540
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,480
In Ukraine, there were points of it. We saw it there too.

541
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,920
They didn't care about the currency anymore,
it was possible to exchange it on the street.

542
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,640
In short, there were some obvious changes.

543
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:43,240
People's Movement, Chornovyl, a lot of
dissidents were released, they came back.

544
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,188
In short, something is happening.

545
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:53,080
We came to Minsk, and they didn't even
understand what they were talking about.

546
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:58,440
They had the same salaries, I remember there was such a shock.

547
00:29:59,012 --> 00:30:03,560
All the journalists gathered, there were 7 of us.

548
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:14,640
Time, Guardian, Christian Science Monitor,
something else, but I won't go into details.

549
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,640
We were in some kind of cafe, there
were a few of them in Kyiv and they were called

550
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,640
cooperative restaurants, they started to appear.

551
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:33,767
And since the exchange rate was
crazy, something for a dollar,

552
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:40,887
and we didn't have money, as we hold them now,
carefully folded, because they were pennies.

553
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:44,961
If you earned, let's say, 500,

554
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:49,967
it was considered that you were a billionaire
if you had a salary of 200 dollars a month.

555
00:30:49,992 --> 00:30:56,109
200 dollars in Kyiv in 1990, in 1991,
well, that's it, life was successful.

556
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,600
And that's why it was so intense.

557
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,947
And here someone runs and says, Yeltsin came,
we need a taxi, we need to go to the airport.

558
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:13,441
And we all jump, hands in
our pockets and on the table like this.

559
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:19,841
We threw it away because
it's 20 cents, 50 cents,

560
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:23,600
30, 50 cents, well, something like that.

561
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,028
I was the last one to throw money.

562
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:36,793
Such a small pile of these squashed
rubles, and an oppressive silence fell.

563
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:41,568
The whole hall of this dining room, because
it's not a restaurant, it's a dining room,

564
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:44,174
the waiters ran out, all of them.

565
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:49,141
Because for them, still, 200 rubles salary is good.

566
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:52,050
And we threw away, probably, a thousand rubles.

567
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:56,839
And a thousand rubles was there, 3 dollars, for 7 people.

568
00:31:57,705 --> 00:32:02,859
And we threw it away and ran
away, it's not money, it's not money.

569
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,951
Then I flew to Georgia for the war.

570
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:12,169
I just had a translator on the table, and there was a driver.

571
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:18,291
And I put a thousand rubles on the table,
I say, to eat, to order something.

572
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:22,101
And they also looked at me, wow, a thousand rubles.

573
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,292
And it's nothing, it's 5 dollars or 4 dollars.

574
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,363
Well, and we came, yes,
really talked, we saw

575
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:35,388
Shushkevych, we saw Yeltsin, I think I even asked some of them.

576
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,413
How close were you to them?

577
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:40,514
Well, then there was no ban.

578
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:48,047
Then to stand next to Yeltsin is, well,
as we sit with you.

579
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Well, the only thing is that there was
protection, but it was much easier then.

580
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:02,352
On the airfield, in Kyiv, everywhere we met near the stairs.

581
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:03,853
It was normal.

582
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:07,878
Then already during Kuchma's time,
 it began to change a little.

583
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:11,511
During Kravchuk's tie, you just came,
oh, you're a journalist? Okay.

584
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,826
Was it a ritual thing, they had
already signed an agreement?

585
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:17,244
No, then we figured out everything as it was.

586
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:25,318
Nobody, just one person of us all, got
there in Viskuli, or where they signed it.

587
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:37,935
The beginning was like this. Yeltsin brought
a document, laid it on the table, and said,

588
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:49,176
'Leonid Makarovich, you can do whatever
you want, mark it, change it, mark it,

589
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,920
write it down, do whatever you
want, but you have to accept it.'

590
00:33:54,543 --> 00:34:00,551
Kravchuk said, 'You know, a
week ago, I was elected president

591
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:03,960
with the pre-election program
for the independence of Ukraine.

592
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,907
It was somehow strange that was now for the Union.

593
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:10,600
A week ago, I was against
the Union, and now…'

594
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:15,748
And then this phrase came up in the sauna.

595
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:18,501
In the sauna, not because
they were naked there,

596
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:21,080
it's not the top officials,
but the country's second persons.

597
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,840
It was just that it was free.

598
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,320
They just came in in suits, there was just a room.

599
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:33,861
And there, this geopolitical
reality of the previously named

600
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:38,574
Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics ceases to exist.

601
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,228
It's just that they thought for two hours,

602
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,502
and the phrase 'geopolitical reality of the

603
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:49,400
previously named Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics ceases to exist.'

604
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,640
And then it got easier.

605
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,600
Yes.

606
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,788
But it all started only when Kravchuk said,

607
00:34:55,812 --> 00:35:01,400
'No, no, no, guys, we're
not joking here, it's serious.'

608
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,188
Integral nationalists spoke
out against it here in Kyiv,

609
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:10,548
like Stepan Ilkovich Khmara,

610
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:18,732
and Chornovyl... there was a lot of diversity there.

611
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:26,489
Why, Mykola, didn't we make such a quantum
jump with little blood as Baltica did?

612
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,359
It's impossible.

613
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:29,224
Why?

614
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:31,248
It`s all just conversations that...

615
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:35,385
Because the Baltic States...

616
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:39,167
Well, you will be guilty, not me...

617
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:41,325
We are not Europeans.

618
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:45,149
The Baltics considered themselves
from the very beginning to be Europeans,

619
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:48,353
we became Europeans only in 2014.

620
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:52,262
But now we paved the path somehow.

621
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,988
Estonians...

622
00:35:57,012 --> 00:36:01,817
I was in Estonia in 1976 with my father.

623
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:02,943
I was walking around Tallinn.

624
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:10,078
There was a home cathedral in every capital.
And I came up to go on and they said,

625
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:18,200
''Excuse me, please, we are already
closed. Do you want something?''

626
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I said, ''Yes, I would like to... Where are you from?''

627
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:25,200
I said, ''I'm from Kyiv.''

628
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
''What language do you speak there?''

629
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,730
I said, ''Ukrainian.''

630
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,032
''Please, come in.''

631
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:34,200
Forest brothers.

632
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
That's the question.

633
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:40,200
I lied because in
Kyiv Ukrainian is... Yes.

634
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Yes, of course.

635
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,200
It was used by 0.5%. But I understood
because I was already trained in nationalism.

636
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Did your father speak Ukrainian or
Russian at the Academy of Sciences?

637
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,794
It's also a complicated story.

638
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:55,018
While there was Shelest, everyone spoke Ukrainian.

639
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,200
The plenum of the Central Committee was held in Ukrainian.

640
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Really?

641
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,800
Yes.

642
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:08,761
Until 1972, the plenums of the Central
Committee during Shelest were in Ukrainian.

643
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:17,200
Then Shcherbitsky came and gradually,
then Malanchuk, this famous Lviv guy.

644
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,287
I had a fight with him twice, by the way.

645
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,200
With the main enemy of all of Ukraine.

646
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
It's very strange that he is from Halychyna.

647
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
He is from Galichina, yes.

648
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,200
And that's why they always didn't want to be Soviet.

649
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:41,629
And here, apart from Galichina, Volhynia,
Bukovina... Was there any strategy?

650
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:45,948
Well, look, if in the
Baltic states, for example,

651
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,859
this umbilical cord was not
cut by the so-called Soviets,

652
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:53,248
and they remembered it, and it was important
for them as a language, and so on...

653
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:57,200
Forty years ago, not all of them died, not all of them.

654
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Well, yes.

655
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,296
And in our country, especially in Halychyna, at least the Bandera movement,

656
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:08,005
what about in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa?

657
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,200
I understand that they had more dissidents in the Baltic states.

658
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
They didn't have dissidents.

659
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,383
It's a very complicated issue.

660
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:17,175
The statistics there seem to be Ukrainian and Baltic.

661
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,668
The question is that the
Baltics themselves once told me

662
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:21,200
that they all are nationalists.

663
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,882
We don't have any non-nationalists.

664
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,200
Unlike the Ukrainians, not all of them are nationalists in Ukraine.

665
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,740
But if they are already nationalists, they're
so passionate that we still need to learn from them,

666
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Because they are all a little bit.

667
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
And a little bit like this.

668
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,645
And what language do you speak?

669
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:41,708
And if Ukraine becomes a nationalist,
then we will burn

670
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:43,796
the commandments of the Party.

671
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,780
That's why it was like that.

672
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:53,026
In 1991, the communists voted for the
creation of another state, of course, Ukraine.

673
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
And what is the concept?

674
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,019
How do they see this state?

675
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,044
What did they want?

676
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,069
They didn't see anything.

677
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:01,094
They had to hide.

678
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,119
This is the same conversation.

679
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,144
Look, 33 years.

680
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:05,169
We are standing next to that post.

681
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
And we are talking again.

682
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,988
We will keep talking until the generation changes.

683
00:39:11,694 --> 00:39:17,268
When Yosep Zisels teaches us,

684
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:21,200
when I talk to him, I say,
Yosep, you are a smart person.

685
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
You know everything.

686
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,200
You were in prison for nationalism with such a nickname.

687
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,805
And he says, well, it's the same as we have.

688
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,980
He says, I mean, when they say 40 years, they were walking in the desert.

689
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,641
So we are the same.

690
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,981
I say, what do you
mean, he says, well, look,

691
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:40,569
in the 90s, 10 years, the
communists were in power.

692
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:44,768
The 00s - Komsomol people.

693
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
The 10s - pioneers.

694
00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:50,729
We have to survive the Octobrists.

695
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,951
And now you are 40 years old.

696
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,634
So now we still have 5 years, 4 years,
6 years, and we will almost lose them.

697
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Here.

698
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
What did they want from the country?

699
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
They were running away.

700
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I was one of the few, even among journalists.

701
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I went down to the cinema hall
of the Verkhovna Rada on August 24th,

702
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,200
where the communists were going to decide
how to vote for them on Independence Day.

703
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,026
And I realized that the concept is this.

704
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:27,200
There is a quiet life here, more or less.

705
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:32,851
Kravchuk, the second secretary of the Central Committee, is a head.

706
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:37,448
And what Yeltsin will do there, we don't know.

707
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:40,200
And we are afraid of him because he is such an anti-communist.

708
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:44,880
And let's separate and protect ourselves.

709
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:51,200
In Moscow, they will ban the Communist
Party and maybe they will all be put in prison.

710
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Nobody knew then.

711
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Whether they will ban or not, imprison or not.

712
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:01,980
And we are here, an autonomous
Ukrainian republic, with our own legislation.

713
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:05,508
The majority of the Verkhovna Rada
are Communists, 239,

714
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:06,837
with the Socialists together.

715
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:09,955
And we will live as we lived before.

716
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,788
We will not build communism,

717
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:20,200
maybe not even socialism, but at
least we will not build nationalism.

718
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:25,588
So wait, if Poland was a social camp,

719
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:29,696
then the leaders would come out and
open the archives, at least, of the KGB.

720
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:33,200
Listen, what are we talking about?

721
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,565
In 1991, after the independence,

722
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:41,575
when it was announced that there
would be a vote on December 1st,

723
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,200
presidential candidates began to emerge, including Chornovil.

724
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,063
I came to him literally across the road,
he lived in a hotel Kyiv, and I will not lie,

725
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:55,928
he did not say that he would win the election and become president.

726
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,200
But everyone around him said that he would become president.

727
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:06,024
And already in 1997, literally
a year before his death,

728
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:12,175
we met, we had good
relations with Vyacheslav Maksimovich.

729
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,737
And he says, Mykola, it's good that I didn't become president.

730
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:16,762
I say, why?

731
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:20,200
He says, well, I think that only now
the civil war would have ended.

732
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:25,152
90% of the population of Ukraine
didn't have nationalism.

733
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
The Ukrainian language?

734
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,716
What are we talking about?

735
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:36,995
I always joke that in Khreshchatyk five
people spoke the Ukrainian language.

736
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,020
Four of them were from the diaspora,
and I was speaking in surzhik.

737
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:51,175
He did not evoke such strong feelings as
Yanukovych did for us, the Orange Party.

738
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Well, wait, this is not the issue.

739
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,122
No, why does he talk about the civil war?

740
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:05,081
Because ... Did he really think
that people would rise against him?

741
00:43:05,106 --> 00:43:07,482
Well, it wasn't like that ... Not
against him, against the ideas.

742
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:09,467
Well, against the ideas.

743
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:13,200
People for 70 years had been told that the Soviet Union was good.

744
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:16,200
And here comes a person who says, no, the Soviet Union is bulls**t.

745
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
What do you think?

746
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,200
There is such a magic button, where you press
it and everyone will change their mind.

747
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Very few people thought so.

748
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
It was gradual.

749
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:31,687
Volyn and Bukovina were still communists.

750
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:42,200
A quasi-European view,
if we take the vote in the Verkhovna Rada,

751
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:46,628
had Kyiv, which was surprising, because
Kyiv was entirely Russian-speaking,

752
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,200
but everyone understood that ...

753
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,661
The capital.

754
00:43:49,686 --> 00:43:51,686
And Galichina.

755
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:55,049
And in Volyn, the communists also came in.

756
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,696
In short, it's all just talk
that it can be skipped somehow.

757
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:04,200
There will be no quick changes.

758
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,654
It is necessary for the country to grow.

759
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:15,032
When we were sitting with
Zhvanecki, he said to me,

760
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:18,200
Mykola, the country must come up.

761
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
It just won't jump.

762
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
It is necessary for it to prepare.

763
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:24,200
And it's true.

764
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,175
And I have long said that I am a
supporter of natural historical processes.

765
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,200
When they say now, it was necessary earlier, it was necessary ...

766
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,798
You won't say to a woman, why
didn't you give birth in two months?

767
00:44:38,823 --> 00:44:40,395
Why did you wait for nine months?

768
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,200
No one says that.

769
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,397
So does the nation.

770
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,930
The Belarusians only come to their senses in 2020.

771
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:50,200
Something started to come
out on the streets.

772
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,200
The Russians haven't come to their senses yet.

773
00:44:54,612 --> 00:44:55,573
The Georgians have come to their senses yet.

774
00:44:55,598 --> 00:44:58,200
The Azerbaijanis haven't come to their senses yet.

775
00:44:58,557 --> 00:45:00,078
TV.

776
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,200
When you have already come there,

777
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,200
I want you to tell as a person who
watched the world from his place,

778
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,200
from the place of a TV presenter, a journalist.

779
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,200
A person who came to a temple of art.

780
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
What can I say?

781
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,816
Contemporary, but art.

782
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Well, you are immediately on the channel 1+1.

783
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
No, I started to work...

784
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,200
I didn't like television at all.

785
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:35,200
Because in BBC I did everything myself.

786
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,612
From the beginning to the end.

787
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:37,993
I was not dependent on anyone.

788
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,795
I ran, took interviews, then cut this film.

789
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,153
Then they cut the film.

790
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:44,472
Wrote.

791
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:47,736
In short, it was all mine and I knew how I worked.

792
00:45:48,154 --> 00:45:49,431
Here is the cameraman.

793
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,431
He sets up.

794
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:54,061
Here is the sound.

795
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:55,200
There is the light.

796
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
And you are always around with

797
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
a lot of people.

798
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,200
You depend on them all.

799
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
I was angry.

800
00:46:01,295 --> 00:46:03,492
But I was convinced by Sashko Krivenko.

801
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,200
And the first thing that started.

802
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
Not Rodnyansky?

803
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
No, no, no.

804
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
This is before Rodnyansky.

805
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,200
At first, Sasha Tkachenko had afterword.

806
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,200
Yes.

807
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:17,603
Parallel.

808
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:18,628
I don't remember which of them.

809
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,162
The first or the second.

810
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,620
Mykola Kniazhynsky created MNC Internews.

811
00:46:23,763 --> 00:46:24,763
There was.

812
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:29,200
And I, since I earned money.

813
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
And then there was such a system
of traveling abroad.

814
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:36,200
That you had to pay.

815
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,200
That is, you can be taken by the
Minister of Foreign Affairs on a plane.

816
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,200
But it doesn't mean that you will
live there for free.

817
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:48,708
And since few people had currency,
I was sometimes taken by ministers.

818
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:51,953
Or the president Kuchma once took me.

819
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,658
And I flew with them.

820
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:59,200
And since I flew there, I just
had money so that I could live there in a hotel.

821
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,419
Eat and so on.

822
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:09,175
Tkachenko says, 'You're going to fly anyway.'

823
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Well, yes.

824
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,200
You will still work for the BBC. Yes.

825
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,555
So I'll give you a cameraman.

826
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,200
So you shoot something there and that's it.

827
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,881
So I started shooting.

828
00:47:17,906 --> 00:47:20,294
And the same with Kniazhynsky.

829
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,109
I worked with him.

830
00:47:21,134 --> 00:47:23,029
I had Windows to the World.

831
00:47:23,054 --> 00:47:32,459
This is the first non-governmental
program in Ukraine called Windows to the World.

832
00:47:33,078 --> 00:47:36,944
Then it turned out that Windows, then STB, and so on.

833
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:38,746
But firstly it was Windows to the World.

834
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:39,771
And we did it.

835
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:43,347
Rostik Hotin, Vitalik Portnikov and I.

836
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:45,812
We took turns for weeks.

837
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:46,961
A week for him, a week for me...

838
00:47:49,877 --> 00:47:55,748
And then Yulia Mostova called me and
said, listen, one person is calling you now.

839
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:57,200
I say, what will he want from me?

840
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,200
She says he will want you to do
something on TV.

841
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,200
I resisted.

842
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,200
I didn't like this idea right away.

843
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,429
And then Lyosha called.

844
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,200
We met, went to the restaurant.

845
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,766
I can even remember what restaurant we went to if I wanted to.

846
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:21,200
And then he came up with this 1+1.

847
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,200
And there was a long fight there.

848
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:27,200
Lyosha, this is Oleksandr Rodnyansky for the viewers.

849
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Yes.

850
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Oleksandr Rodnyansky.

851
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:30,624
This is Yuhymovich.

852
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:37,964
He just then says, listen, look at Inter, it's
all in Russian, they have the highest ratings.

853
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:43,958
That is, the society didn't want it.

854
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:45,828
The journalists' language was Russian,

855
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:48,200
the business language was Russian,
the medical language was Russian.

856
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,200
How was it chosen in what language
the channel broadcasts?

857
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
It was very long.

858
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:53,657
There were discussions.

859
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:57,200
It was very, very...
Well, it wasn`t chosen.

860
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,200
By trial and error.

861
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:03,508
Then there was a long discussion, because

862
00:49:03,532 --> 00:49:08,200
there was no peoplemeter, so
we couldn't calculate.

863
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:12,471
I remember that we called KVN.

864
00:49:14,129 --> 00:49:17,793
KVN means an asphalt roller.

865
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:23,548
I mean, everything in
Russian was much better,

866
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:27,991
and there were one, two, three programs
among Russian ones, that's an asphalt roller.

867
00:49:28,016 --> 00:49:32,595
You can turn off the signal and
not broadcast at all.

868
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:33,795
I don't know.

869
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,428
In the province where I lived,
for example, in Zhytomyr,

870
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:39,668
it didn't look like that, because
when the 1+1 began to broadcast,

871
00:49:39,692 --> 00:49:41,821
the evening slot, everyone
was sitting next to the screen.

872
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:47,566
No, it was when he began to broadcast fully
when we had already done it.

873
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:51,200
When I was doing Taboo on 1+1...

874
00:49:52,147 --> 00:49:55,861
And this convinced Aleksandr Yukhymovych.

875
00:49:56,234 --> 00:49:59,200
Because he says, well, maybe
Russian, after all...

876
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,960
Inter, you see, it is like this, and it has a Russian language.

877
00:50:03,985 --> 00:50:06,784
And we had to put in a lot more effort than Inter.

878
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:09,200
Inter is just so beautiful, and everyone is watching.

879
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:17,200
And 1+1... Did 1+1 rely on
intellectual viewers, on Ukrainian viewers?

880
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,200
We had an ideology. We always had an ideology.

881
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
In general, I still think that without an ideology it is difficult.

882
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Pro-Ukrainian, pro-European, civilizational.

883
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
We came up with it there.

884
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,389
We discussed something, translated.

885
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:36,322
Lyosha, Oseledchik.

886
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:40,895
There were a lot of people who
came up with all these concepts.

887
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:44,753
But you consciously chose a
smaller segment of viewers, right?

888
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:49,175
I will be honest, I was undoubtedly
the deputy general producer.

889
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,585
But I concentrated more on my work.

890
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,200
And at my job, I said, I would not speak Russian.

891
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,672
I don't want to.

892
00:50:57,697 --> 00:50:59,697
And what about politics at that time?

893
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:01,722
Such a channel is starting to get popular.

894
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:05,747
Politics... Very
few politicians.

895
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:06,772
Easy.

896
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,723
They all switched to Ukrainian.

897
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:10,748
Well, all nationalists.

898
00:51:10,773 --> 00:51:11,773
Well, as it were.

899
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Active ones.

900
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,683
How did they treat 1+1?

901
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:16,104
Oh, I don't know.

902
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:17,706
I had to... Who did
Rodnyansky come to?

903
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:20,780
He says I will have a Ukrainian-speaking channel.

904
00:51:21,089 --> 00:51:22,089
1+1.

905
00:51:22,114 --> 00:51:24,391
Well, at first he came to Lauder.

906
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,360
At first, it was
still... Investor.

907
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:29,385
Yes.

908
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:37,011
This is the son of Estee Lauder,
who made perfumes.

909
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
Yes.

910
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
It means that.

911
00:51:41,193 --> 00:51:47,965
And American billionaires, they had such
a fashion that you need to make people happy.

912
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:53,068
If you have a lot of money,
and at Lauder, I think,

913
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,880
Ronald received something
like 9 billion or 7 billion.

914
00:51:57,913 --> 00:51:59,395
That is, for him, this is such a missionary work.

915
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,213
Yes.

916
00:52:00,238 --> 00:52:01,238
And he needed...

917
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:03,590
Someone gave him the
idea that in the east of Europe,

918
00:52:03,614 --> 00:52:07,175
there are such new countries,
where they can watch TV.

919
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,873
Yes.

920
00:52:07,898 --> 00:52:09,200
And he started looking.

921
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,200
And Lyosha was in Germany at that time, and he went there.

922
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,200
Somehow, I don't know how they found each other there.

923
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,564
And, in short, now it looks ridiculous.

924
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:22,015
I think... I can make a mistake.

925
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,189
This is purely speculation.

926
00:52:23,214 --> 00:52:25,303
I think it's 22 million dollars.

927
00:52:25,652 --> 00:52:28,137
Now you can't make half a channel
for that money.

928
00:52:28,162 --> 00:52:30,732
And then you could make a full-fledged channel.

929
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:32,654
So, about asphalt roller.

930
00:52:33,146 --> 00:52:37,802
And I remember one of the first of these peoplemeters came.

931
00:52:38,226 --> 00:52:39,226
Calculated.

932
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,639
Taboo had...

933
00:52:42,664 --> 00:52:45,988
Well, now there aren`t
such ratings as there were,

934
00:52:46,012 --> 00:52:48,851
but now I would be appointed the leader
of all the channels in Ukraine at once.

935
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:49,851
Just all.

936
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:53,372
I had something like 52... Would
you be the head of the TV marathon?

937
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:55,200
No, not the head.

938
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:02,605
And the master, Maslyakov, and this is
such a nickname of Maslyakov, was the master.

939
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,661
He had something 42.

940
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:06,175
I came and said...

941
00:53:09,574 --> 00:53:12,817
That is, the question is not in the language,
but in the quality of the product.

942
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:16,842
If you have a quality product, then the language does not matter.

943
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:19,797
Ukrainian will be as popular as Russian.

944
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,361
Where did you get this format?

945
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,660
I came up with it myself. I came up with everything myself.

946
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:34,589
I even remember where at the ASK I
came up with who should be the first guest.

947
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:39,200
The first guest was supposed to be named Made in Ukraine.

948
00:53:39,923 --> 00:53:46,638
That is, everyone who became
popular during the Ukrainian era.

949
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:48,175
And who were they?

950
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:54,200
Well, El Kravchuk, if you remember him.

951
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Yes.

952
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:06,200
Rusya Pysanka, Klichko brothers, who then lived in Kyiv.

953
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:09,293
They came to me, I thought I
showed them like this with my finger.

954
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:12,318
They came to me and said, we
will be the champions of the world.

955
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,477
First of all, they are white.

956
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,200
At the time when I made the program,
the champions of the world were only black.

957
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,200
And here are two such idiots, white.

958
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:28,703
They come and say, we will be the
champions of the world in professional boxing.

959
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,856
Well, you need to turn on your brains.

960
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:36,777
And here are a few such people.

961
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:39,009
Then I realized that we just didn't have so many stars.

962
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:43,951
Then came Blokhin, but Blokhin was
not Made in Ukraine, but Made in the USA.

963
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:45,435
Well, yes.

964
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,175
But the first five or seven, I don't even
remember how many programs there were.

965
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,331
I said, no, we only need those who were born in 1991.

966
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:59,327
And they gained popularity
not because of Moscow,

967
00:54:59,351 --> 00:55:02,737
not because they were
shown on central television.

968
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:07,239
Well, it was such a concept.

969
00:55:09,183 --> 00:55:11,966
Lyosha came up with the name Taboo.

970
00:55:12,196 --> 00:55:12,608
Rodnyansky.

971
00:55:12,633 --> 00:55:13,664
Yes, Rodnyansky.

972
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:19,200
Was there a political influence,
censorship, or reviews?

973
00:55:20,129 --> 00:55:22,129
It was, it was.

974
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:24,154
Did Rodnyansky stand with a
shield in front of everyone?

975
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
No, no, it was difficult.

976
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
This is ambiguous.

977
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Here Rodnyansky becomes such a double or triple or quadrilateral.

978
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,200
Because he needed it, this was his business.

979
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
This is his responsibility.

980
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
This is the money of Launder.

981
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,866
I don't know if it was necessary to give it away.

982
00:55:42,891 --> 00:55:45,891
Was it business for him or still a political influence?

983
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:47,916
Business, business, business, of course.

984
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,941
No, he didn't want to give it away.

985
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:52,495
He then went on STS or something.

986
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:52,991
Right.

987
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,016
Well, in short, he started something in Russia.

988
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,598
Just the condition of his transition was
that the channel had no news.

989
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:06,200
And there are no political… He burned
himself, because, yes, it can be understood.

990
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Yes, and he wanted to, he just tried to avoid it.

991
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Although I could convince him, and
we had a huge scandal, as a result, I left.

992
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,838
Just because… Well,
how was it then?

993
00:56:17,863 --> 00:56:19,863
It wasn't the same as it is now.

994
00:56:19,888 --> 00:56:24,470
In principle, censorship exists in one way or another.

995
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:27,200
Well, in comparison with
the 1990s, it is not censorship at all.

996
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
But then there was total censorship.

997
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,988
For example, if you like Malevich,

998
00:56:35,012 --> 00:56:41,200
and the friend of the owner of the
channel doesn't like Malevich, the artist,

999
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,588
and you came and said that the
exhibition of Malevich is wonderful,

1000
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,012
then tomorrow you will
be expelled from work.

1001
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:52,200
Because that person called
and said, What's up, Vasya?

1002
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,200
This Malevich is s**t.

1003
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,200
And this fool says that he is good.

1004
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,200
What are you allowed to do there?

1005
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,200
It was everywhere.

1006
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Sports.

1007
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Only the weather seemed to be untouched.

1008
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,200
Although I don't know, I'm not sure.

1009
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,200
And I remember, I was in charge…

1010
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,200
When Tkachenko left, I was in charge of TSN for a couple of months.

1011
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:15,200
Oh my God.

1012
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:24,200
Well, I'm such a boss, we have such a daily order, etc.

1013
00:57:24,748 --> 00:57:27,200
And then Lazarenko was the prime minister.

1014
00:57:27,718 --> 00:57:28,601
Well?

1015
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:30,085
What?

1016
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:33,104
What?

1017
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:35,608
Why do allow Lazarenko to speak out?

1018
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:37,200
What the hell is that?

1019
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:40,175
Well, it's not Rodnyansky, I won't
say the name.

1020
00:57:40,777 --> 00:57:42,200
Or maybe I will one day.

1021
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:46,200
And I thought, okay.

1022
00:57:46,952 --> 00:57:48,824
The next day, I say, let's do something.

1023
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:52,200
Lazarenko, not in the first place, but in the second.

1024
00:57:53,142 --> 00:57:55,200
Hello, do we not have the prime minister of this country?

1025
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,200
You didn't have a choice.

1026
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:04,089
On the third day, you can say, let's not
put him in the third place, but in the eighth.

1027
00:58:04,788 --> 00:58:07,994
And on the fourth day, he's not there at all.

1028
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:10,746
And on the fifth day, why is he not there?

1029
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:12,200
Our prime minister is not there.

1030
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,200
And on the fifth day…
You couldn't kick him?

1031
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,200
You should have hit him in the face.

1032
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:22,200
And on the tenth day…
Not so much.

1033
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,780
A little bit.

1034
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:25,805
Why are you hitting him in the face?

1035
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,399
And you sit there, damn it.

1036
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:31,200
There are no options.

1037
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,867
I always… But there are
unique people among us.

1038
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:38,200
Slava Pihovshchek always impressed me.

1039
00:58:39,043 --> 00:58:40,200
Obviously.

1040
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,225
And I think there are such people in Moscow now.

1041
00:58:43,471 --> 00:58:45,200
Is he a phenomenon or not?

1042
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Why?

1043
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,228
Because, you know, most
people have the impression that

1044
00:58:51,252 --> 00:58:55,068
censorship is when I, for
example, the presenter,

1045
00:58:55,092 --> 00:59:00,200
call the presidential administration
and say, what am I supposed to say here?

1046
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,394
No, no, no.

1047
00:59:01,898 --> 00:59:03,711
I have to feel it.

1048
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,997
I have to feel it.

1049
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:10,606
Because these people are busy with business.

1050
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,631
They need to steal from the state.

1051
00:59:12,656 --> 00:59:14,820
There are many things in the state that can be stolen.

1052
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,268
And I have to know this
without taking consultations,

1053
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:26,714
without calling, but feeling that
now we need to stress it right here.

1054
00:59:27,803 --> 00:59:28,803
Unique people.

1055
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:30,476
I am delighted.

1056
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:32,200
It didn't work out that way.

1057
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,745
And did Pikhovshek understand this?

1058
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,770
Yes.

1059
00:59:34,795 --> 00:59:38,175
He is unique precisely because
he understood how it goes up there.

1060
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,200
How it goes there, where it goes there.

1061
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,200
How can you understand if
you are not there?

1062
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,200
No, well, he always said he
was there, but he had never been there.

1063
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:48,429
Oh, I see.

1064
00:59:48,521 --> 00:59:53,119
He constantly talked about
it, emphasizing that he was

1065
00:59:53,143 --> 00:59:55,171
on a first-name basis, as they said

1066
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:58,111
in the 19th century in the Russian
Empire,

1067
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:00,175
on a first-name basis with the president.

1068
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,200
And I was tired to listen to it.

1069
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,835
I remember saying to someone,
I will not say name, ...

1070
01:00:05,536 --> 01:00:09,976
And when you go to the president, well, this is
all over the world, this is not only in Ukraine.

1071
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:12,434
It's everywhere, in the US, anywhere.

1072
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,948
They write it down.

1073
01:00:13,972 --> 01:00:20,175
You can't just come in without writing that you
have been there for so long, it's a security.

1074
01:00:21,691 --> 01:00:26,868
And I say to them, go to the
president's office, Kuchma,

1075
01:00:26,892 --> 01:00:29,920
and see when he has
been there for the last time.

1076
01:00:29,945 --> 01:00:31,651
He goes in and says...

1077
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:38,200
It was in the summer of
some year, he says, in January.

1078
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,864
I see a big combination.

1079
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:43,828
Yes. But it's real art.

1080
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:52,175
It's art to guess in the
distance what's going on in the big house.

1081
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,855
Well, it's like that. He set 1+1
up, I must say.

1082
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
And then…

1083
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,823
1+1 apologized,
Aleksandr Yefimovich – in the same way?

1084
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,711
This page, by the way… Yes,
but there wasn`t everything ambiguous.

1085
01:01:06,736 --> 01:01:07,569
Unambiguous?

1086
01:01:07,594 --> 01:01:09,468
Unambiguous, yes.

1087
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:15,126
And just people at 1+1... I think
some part, not all, not everyone,

1088
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:18,683
understood that the wind
won't blow in that direction.

1089
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,200
Really, it's… You weren't there at all.
You were already on the 5th channel.

1090
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,268
Yes, I was already on the 5th
channel. But I… Well, since

1091
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:28,730
not much time has passed,
I know many people.

1092
01:01:28,755 --> 01:01:31,976
In fact, most of them have not changed in appearance.

1093
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:37,233
I would not say that the behavior of 1+1

1094
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:43,175
was as perfect as possible, not
only because of Pikhovshen, not only.

1095
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:49,148
I think that Lyosha Rodiansky
was well-organized,

1096
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:54,200
and he understood that if
we say that this is business,

1097
01:01:54,994 --> 01:02:00,200
then it is necessary to save it, and
there was already a feeling.

1098
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:03,908
I did not have a feeling that
we had won on the 5th channel.

1099
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,839
I was afraid that something would
happen to me until the last moment.

1100
01:02:06,864 --> 01:02:08,200
Well, until the third round.

1101
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,260
Yes.

1102
01:02:10,284 --> 01:02:15,142
And people who, maybe because he
was in Moscow and was more away from it,

1103
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:18,200
because I was watching it from the inside,

1104
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:24,714
and he was on the side, maybe it
helped him to tell himself that it`s not right.

1105
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:25,739
We are not going there.

1106
01:02:25,764 --> 01:02:26,603
Yes, we are losing something here.

1107
01:02:26,628 --> 01:02:27,628
We are coming in.

1108
01:02:27,653 --> 01:02:35,175
Yes. And so it was. And then it went on.
But, listen, these are all very difficult moments.

1109
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:49,200
And until TV is not a business, until
there is no option of freedom, it cannot be.

1110
01:02:49,694 --> 01:02:54,685
All the talks about the fact
that TV can somehow speak the truth,

1111
01:02:55,344 --> 01:03:01,200
the American can, because this
is a business, these are profits.

1112
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Ethier in 2017 or 2018,
I don't remember, they added 800 million dollars.

1113
01:03:17,596 --> 01:03:19,200
It is also such a story, Mr. Mykolo.

1114
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,298
Because, you know, if CNN is for democracy,

1115
01:03:23,323 --> 01:03:28,761
and Fox is for the Republicans,
then this is already a split, right?

1116
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:35,882
But the problem is that this is their
belief, not an instruction.

1117
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:43,200
They just don't hire Fox people
who will sympathize with the Democrats.

1118
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,200
They don't hire in CNN...

1119
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,200
Do we already copy this system?
Do we have channels?

1120
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,200
Unfortunately, I don't know.
We don't have such a division.

1121
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,200
Only in the worst possible way, I think.

1122
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,200
The question is different. It is very simple.

1123
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:10,423
Here is a billionaire sitting, and Natalka Moseichuk has a rating of 50%.

1124
01:04:12,147 --> 01:04:15,467
And Mykola Veresen has a rating of 5%.

1125
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:24,200
And here he is, this billionaire, who
pays so much to maintain the channel.

1126
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,403
In any way.

1127
01:04:25,882 --> 01:04:28,882
When there is Oprah Winfrey, who earned a billion for herself,

1128
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:32,479
and how much she earned for the channel, it's just hard to imagine.

1129
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,868
And that rich man, who is the owner.

1130
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,948
Well, how is it? I won't take away Oprah.
Then I'll just throw money out of my pocket.

1131
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,734
And in Ukraine, there is no such thing.

1132
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Either the worst presenter.

1133
01:04:48,225 --> 01:04:51,200
Or the best. Either a program with the
highest ratings.

1134
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,200
Or a program with the lowest ratings.

1135
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,200
I add up to 100 million per year.

1136
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,964
Before the war, the 1+1 came to zero.

1137
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Well, it's not a profit, Natalka, it's not a profit.

1138
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:10,200
When it's equal ... I agree, absolutely.

1139
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,200
Then it will work.

1140
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,200
All journalism is like this, this, and that.

1141
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,593
Maybe now this TikTok is all modern.

1142
01:05:17,618 --> 01:05:19,200
Or some YouTube.

1143
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
It's very difficult there.

1144
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Maybe something will change there. I don't know.

1145
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,200
It will change if the business starts to work normally.

1146
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
Because we are dependent on the business.

1147
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,108
Even though we're going to burst, but
we

1148
01:05:33,132 --> 01:05:35,200
will not be able to have
a host become Oprah

1149
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,200
and bring millions and billions to the channel.

1150
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
No, not yet.

1151
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,200
No, listen, we are secondary, we are tertiary.

1152
01:05:43,483 --> 01:05:45,200
The question is not that.

1153
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,148
The question is that
television works

1154
01:05:50,172 --> 01:05:59,271
in those countries where there is
good production and good salaries.

1155
01:06:00,503 --> 01:06:05,804
When each Ukrainian has a salary of 500 dollars,

1156
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:15,439
advertisers understand that we about 10%...

1157
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:20,200
we collect this money, well, through advertising.

1158
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:23,770
And we have 30 or 40 million.

1159
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:32,762
We take 500 dollars for 40 million, multiply it, and then take 10%.

1160
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:39,719
And we have billions on the market.

1161
01:06:39,744 --> 01:06:49,744
Well ... Then Natalka will get
a million a year, for example.

1162
01:06:50,768 --> 01:06:53,200
But we don't have such salaries.

1163
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
Well, first, we don't have such
salaries, because the second is reality.

1164
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
Because what will happen to television?

1165
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,200
It is now only known to God.

1166
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,200
And such a period is critical.

1167
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:06,200
It will either go up and, supposedly,
become CNN or Fox after the war.

1168
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,776
No, it will never become CNN.

1169
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:09,801
Or ... Impossible, because ...

1170
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:12,826
It will become such an entertainment
option of something, where there will be only ...

1171
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:13,851
No, it will be like this.

1172
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:19,175
You see, we have a colonial country.

1173
01:07:19,797 --> 01:07:21,200
For a long, long time.

1174
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:27,200
When my young colleagues ask me,
why there is no BBC, what should we do?

1175
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,828
I say, no, it won't work.

1176
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:38,440
The British have an interesting world
because their neighbor was born in India.

1177
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:43,374
And that's why the British are interested in the news about India.

1178
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:46,853
About Burma, about this, about Africa.

1179
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,472
Who cares about Burma in Ukraine?

1180
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,200
That's it.

1181
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,200
I would ask another question.

1182
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,200
Are they ready to work like on the BBC?

1183
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,200
Because of the way they work there on the BBC,
we would already be shouting, censorship,

1184
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,200
restriction of my journalistic rights, and so on.

1185
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,824
Because it is very, very ...

1186
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,200
It is an obstructed system, I would say.

1187
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,200
But, okay, we will not judge. They have their own rules.

1188
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,643
Kuchma and Gongadze.

1189
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,200
That's right ... That's
right, I won't say.

1190
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
That's right, such
... I won't say.

1191
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,200
A difficult story.

1192
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,200
But you know, right?

1193
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,200
No, I just know ... Why
don't you talk about it?

1194
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,652
Den Borisovich Yanevsky
didn't talk about that.

1195
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:37,922
He also said that he knows
who ... No, I guess ... How?

1196
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:44,947
I know the vector, I don't know by name.

1197
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:51,430
I know the vector, I am strongly of great doubt
that Kuchma was somehow involved there.

1198
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:59,200
And I strongly ... In general, I
will say this phrase beautifully.

1199
01:08:59,225 --> 01:09:00,501
Cherchez la femme.

1200
01:09:00,526 --> 01:09:01,563
I won't say anything more.

1201
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:06,200
You know, the whole country knows who you are targeting.

1202
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,200
But no one wants to touch it because all the figures are alive.

1203
01:09:12,193 --> 01:09:13,200
More or less, yes.

1204
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,200
It's incorrect in relation to both memory and…

1205
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:27,200
No, it's not that. I stopped
this wave and this fashion for a long time.

1206
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:33,951
I'll give you an example.

1207
01:09:33,982 --> 01:09:41,708
When Kryvenko Sashko crashed in the car,

1208
01:09:41,732 --> 01:09:46,207
they wanted to do the second
episode of Gongadze.

1209
01:09:47,837 --> 01:09:51,175
And they wanted to politicize it.

1210
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:56,845
I was just burying Sashko in Lviv.

1211
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:03,175
And I had to go back to Kyiv because
Taras Pratsuk died right that day in Baghdad.

1212
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,047
In Iraq.

1213
01:10:04,072 --> 01:10:07,588
Yes. And these were my two closest friends.

1214
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:14,028
And they just started
saying, let's raise this scandal,

1215
01:10:14,052 --> 01:10:17,377
come on, come on, come on,
we'll earn political dividends on this.

1216
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,200
And I just called a lot of people.

1217
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:26,200
I called Yulia, I said, Yulia,
I beg you, Tymoshenko, stop.

1218
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:30,105
And she said, I heard
you, I understood your logic,

1219
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:33,182
okay, that's it, we're not going to use it.

1220
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:43,313
Just understand how people
really like to exploit politics today.

1221
01:10:43,575 --> 01:10:45,746
And still, journalists are not really politicians.

1222
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:47,771
Well, they shouldn't be politicians at all.

1223
01:10:48,757 --> 01:10:50,837
During the war, probably should.

1224
01:10:51,687 --> 01:10:55,365
Well, you can't not be a patriot,
you can't be independent.

1225
01:10:57,308 --> 01:10:58,302
From the state.

1226
01:10:58,327 --> 01:11:01,828
Yes, from the society, from the state, you know.

1227
01:11:01,853 --> 01:11:06,200
We take the BBC example and do it right,
and we have to follow it.

1228
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,828
But we also have to remember

1229
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:15,537
that in the British territories, when
there was a war? There was never a war.

1230
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,200
There were not a thousand years.

1231
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,097
Here, Wilhelm, the winner, came.

1232
01:11:20,122 --> 01:11:22,200
This, this, this was a disaster.

1233
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,592
And so only rockets flew from above.

1234
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,577
Therefore, you can be independent there.

1235
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:29,738
And they are really independent.

1236
01:11:29,763 --> 01:11:33,098
The BBC was against the
expansion of the Suez Canal,

1237
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,756
against the Maldives, the
Falkland Islands, and so on.

1238
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:38,122
But it's not here.

1239
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,345
What would the BBC be like if there
was an invasion of the Kingdom of Kent?

1240
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:46,310
Well, such, serious, with a foreign presence.

1241
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:47,569
What would they say?

1242
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:48,594
We don't know.

1243
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:53,457
There just wasn't, there was no evidence,
there was no basis for evidence.

1244
01:11:53,482 --> 01:11:59,175
It's not exactly against the invasion of Falkland
but about Margaret Thatcher's politics.

1245
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:04,200
Thatcher, yes, well, Thatcher always
liked to close the BBC, but nothing came of it.

1246
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:10,200
But that's why we don't know how,
where the truth is, you know.

1247
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:14,358
Today, there are no BBC standards in Ukraine.

1248
01:12:14,607 --> 01:12:17,200
Well, what is the war going on,
and what will you say?

1249
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:25,763
So, you want to say that this whole story,
it all leads to such a human, difficult situation?

1250
01:12:26,076 --> 01:12:29,548
Well, I'd say that in 20 years,

1251
01:12:29,572 --> 01:12:34,200
when it will be described, it will
turn out to be very simple, just human.

1252
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:39,428
You know, no one has invented anything more
intelligent than Shakespeare

1253
01:12:39,452 --> 01:12:41,242
in the last 400 years.

1254
01:12:43,075 --> 01:12:45,514
All the plots, they are described there.

1255
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:46,842
But.

1256
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:47,539
In the books.

1257
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:48,200
Yes.

1258
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:54,588
But anyway, you and I used
to go out and carry the banner

1259
01:12:54,612 --> 01:13:00,175
'Who killed Gongadze', and there was
also the banner 'Who ordered Gongadze.'

1260
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,511
And ordering Gongadze is already a political story.

1261
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:11,923
You see, when you build a country, it
seems to us, since the age of a person is short,

1262
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,228
and we, me, who lived then,

1263
01:13:16,252 --> 01:13:24,200
obviously, at that time, we were all
politicized, very much, and I was politicized.

1264
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,200
And we were looking, we were looking
for who is guilty, where is he, where is she.

1265
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,143
And, as a rule, we looked somewhere up at the president.

1266
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:36,828
Now I have become so
wise that I understand that

1267
01:13:36,852 --> 01:13:40,200
even today, when everything is politicized,

1268
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,470
I still try to somehow
... Well, not...

1269
01:13:43,495 --> 01:13:46,852
...not to wear this outfit on myself.

1270
01:13:47,406 --> 01:13:50,166
And when now there is
criticism of those or others,

1271
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,478
Zelensky, Zaluzhny,
and so on, I am so quiet.

1272
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,628
I do not allow myself much,
because I understand that,

1273
01:13:57,652 --> 01:14:00,200
well, not in time, you know, not in time.

1274
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,148
And this is also a
controversy, because today,

1275
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:08,861
on the one hand, it is obvious that
it is difficult during the war to still,

1276
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:12,200
as it were, direct the
bayonets to the government,

1277
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,353
which is in fact bears responsibility for what is happening.

1278
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,572
And, on the other hand, it is necessary to
understand something about freedom of speech.

1279
01:14:20,994 --> 01:14:27,800
And how to find a contact here between the
fact that there were no cases ... Well, yes.

1280
01:14:27,825 --> 01:14:32,948
I specially studied the British
press during the Second World War,

1281
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:37,425
the American press during the Second
World War, and I watched what was there.

1282
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:40,010
Well, there was censorship everywhere, everywhere there was ...

1283
01:14:40,262 --> 01:14:43,946
Somehow they were trying
to find a way to ...

1284
01:14:44,122 --> 01:14:49,200
And on the other hand, there was criticism,
and how to unite it today in today's Ukraine?

1285
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,200
I do not know.

1286
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,200
I have no answer.

1287
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:56,268
Unfortunately, I do not belong to
those brilliant Ukrainian politicians,

1288
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:59,200
historians, politicians
who know everything.

1289
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,200
I do not know everything.

1290
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,200
In the sense, we are going our own way as we are going it.

1291
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,200
No, we ... And God knows
what will happen there.

1292
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,200
As I told you, it is a natural historical process.

1293
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,200
We cannot come up with anything.

1294
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,200
We give birth to what we give birth to.

1295
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,200
When we can give birth.

1296
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,200
Neither sooner nor later.

1297
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,200
Kuchma is accused of cutting back on airplanes.

1298
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,952
Yushchenko cut off the last ones.

1299
01:15:19,977 --> 01:15:22,776
Even without Gongadze.

1300
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:26,552
He is accused of the creation of a clan of the oligarchic system.

1301
01:15:26,973 --> 01:15:27,559
And so on.

1302
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:29,200
Does it also apply?

1303
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,565
Otherwise, we could not?

1304
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,200
Without oligarchs, we could not?

1305
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,200
We could have ... We
could have ... There could be another way.

1306
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,200
But I do not know which way would be better.

1307
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,200
I do not know which way would be better.

1308
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,430
Unfortunately, there are no handbooks.

1309
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,882
If there was a handbook where it was written

1310
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:49,019
one the first page, chapter 1, 1991, do this, this, this, this, this.

1311
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:52,670
I have not seen such a handbook.

1312
01:15:53,177 --> 01:16:00,281
And for some reason, the Estonians
and the Poles succeeded very quickly.

1313
01:16:00,543 --> 01:16:03,875
The Slovaks waited a very long time for them to succeed too.

1314
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:08,200
The Romans and the Bulgarians are still half
... Well, they are in the European Union.

1315
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,265
But to say that they are so ...

1316
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:14,200
With corruption, everything is wonderful,
everything is subdued, you can not say.

1317
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,838
Therefore, Ukraine went like this, Georgia went like this.

1318
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:20,539
Belarus, you see, did not go like this at all.

1319
01:16:20,564 --> 01:16:22,564
Azerbaijan went like this in the Middle East.

1320
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:24,200
No one knows how.

1321
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,200
The Baltic is the same, you know.

1322
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:28,200
And salaries in Estonia ...

1323
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,748
In fact, in Estonia, the only ones who
caught up

1324
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:33,698
with the Western Europeans in salaries.

1325
01:16:35,666 --> 01:16:42,025
Therefore ... Well, they could quickly ...
Could they pull us from the USSR faster?

1326
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:42,723
No.

1327
01:16:42,748 --> 01:16:43,564
Our presidents?

1328
01:16:43,589 --> 01:16:44,589
No.

1329
01:16:44,614 --> 01:16:46,392
I'm sure here.

1330
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:48,060
No one will pull anyone.

1331
01:16:48,093 --> 01:16:57,273
In 2004, I was one of the people
who were in contact with various CRU people.

1332
01:16:57,298 --> 01:17:00,648
Well, before the Orange Revolution.

1333
01:17:01,682 --> 01:17:03,828
I then asked directly, I say,

1334
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:07,241
what are we doing here? You
have a lot of money, let`s go.

1335
01:17:07,727 --> 01:17:20,195
And they said, until you have 100 thousand on
the Maidan, we will not lift a finger.

1336
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:23,887
By ourselves, by ourselves.

1337
01:17:23,912 --> 01:17:24,912
Yes.

1338
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:27,546
More than that. It was all explained.

1339
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:32,120
They told me that we are in the
1960s and 1970s in Latin America.

1340
01:17:32,145 --> 01:17:35,148
This was the Monroe Doctrine of the 1820s.

1341
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:36,828
This is our backyard.

1342
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:40,175
And we decided that this is our backyard.
And then we, sorry for such phrase,

1343
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,068
we f**ked up wherever
we could in Latin America.

1344
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:47,200
And then we realized,
you start, and we can only...

1345
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:52,371
My father told me about his father,
that is, my grandfather Mercury,

1346
01:17:52,395 --> 01:17:54,847
who said a wonderful phrase,

1347
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:57,868
very simple, very beautiful, he said,

1348
01:17:57,892 --> 01:18:02,461
Kostya, you pick it up, and
I'll push it. Not vice versa.

1349
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:11,175
So we have to pick it up, and they can
push it, but this is our job, our responsibility.

1350
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,200
This is the kind of society we have today.

1351
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,988
You have been to Crimea
a lot, and you once said

1352
01:18:17,012 --> 01:18:20,805
that you are ashamed of the Tatars,
and you always apologize to them.

1353
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:25,388
Well, yes, it was in 1990
or 1991, I don't remember,

1354
01:18:25,412 --> 01:18:29,200
there was Grach, the head of
Crimea, and there was Kravchuk,

1355
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,917
and we met in the Verkhovna Rada in Crimea.

1356
01:18:33,366 --> 01:18:35,628
I went up to him and said, listen,

1357
01:18:35,652 --> 01:18:40,200
let's give Crimea and Donbas them, and
we'll be in Europe the day after tomorrow.

1358
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:44,988
I just said that without
thinking about the fact that,

1359
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:48,200
by giving Crimea back, I
give the crowd of people

1360
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,200
under the name of the Crimean Tatar
minority, who are our brothers.

1361
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:58,200
So yes, I repeat, it's always,
it's not a secret, I'm really ashamed of it.

1362
01:18:59,037 --> 01:19:06,708
But today we see some traces
of what I said then, we see them today.

1363
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,200
We see them, Donbas and Crimea.

1364
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:20,546
Do you think that Crimea in the
historical context will still be a special territory?

1365
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:27,490
Well, from the historical perspective, I think
that in 100 years Crimea will be Crimean Tatar.

1366
01:19:29,268 --> 01:19:30,200
Not Ukrainian.

1367
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,840
There may be some combination, but
we don't know what will happen in 100 years.

1368
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:45,200
But the fact that many people want
to have their statehood is obvious.

1369
01:19:46,051 --> 01:19:49,707
And the Crimean Tatar people don't have more land.

1370
01:19:49,732 --> 01:19:51,732
No, they don't.

1371
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:58,200
So it will depend on what the mood will be then.

1372
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,200
Do you understand?

1373
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,200
That's all.

1374
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,939
You ask Kravchuk, Kuchma.

1375
01:20:05,796 --> 01:20:17,200
The first person whom my eyes saw, who
said that the world has changed fundamentally,

1376
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:26,738
and there is no turning in the
undemocratic direction, was Levko Lukyanenko,

1377
01:20:26,763 --> 01:20:30,782
who came out of prison a year
before he said that, from the tribune.

1378
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:33,501
It was in 1990.

1379
01:20:34,488 --> 01:20:37,200
It was in May or April.

1380
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,200
Our Frensis Fukuyama.

1381
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,200
And he said that that's all.

1382
01:20:41,695 --> 01:20:45,200
And we asked him what was going on there.

1383
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,877
It was a congress.

1384
01:20:46,902 --> 01:20:49,148
When the dissidents gathered,

1385
01:20:49,172 --> 01:20:52,688
the Ukrainian Helsinki Association
turned into the Ukrainian Republican Party.

1386
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,200
It was in a Movie House.

1387
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
And then he was the host.

1388
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,163
I thought that I would climb under the table and die there.

1389
01:21:01,188 --> 01:21:03,085
Because they were just swearing.

1390
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,200
The Soviet authorities did not cancel anything.

1391
01:21:05,492 --> 01:21:09,200
The Central Committee, the district committee,
the regional committee, the KGB, the police.

1392
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,200
Everything is here.

1393
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,200
People come out here and say that this will not happen.

1394
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,200
This will not happen.

1395
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
And I asked him why.

1396
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,730
Because the world has changed.

1397
01:21:19,961 --> 01:21:22,638
And democracy has won.

1398
01:21:23,368 --> 01:21:25,200
And civilization has won.

1399
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,043
And so we can be calmer.

1400
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:30,068
We won`t be put in prison anymore.

1401
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:32,093
Poor Levko Lukyanenko.

1402
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:34,118
How he experienced 2004.

1403
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:36,143
And then not the Orange Revolution.

1404
01:21:36,168 --> 01:21:40,168
And how... Excuse me.

1405
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,465
He sat on that s**t.

1406
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:43,089
Do you remember what happened?

1407
01:21:43,114 --> 01:21:44,351
Three rounds of elections.

1408
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:48,957
How it was on the only channel that
 was on the side of the Orange Revolution.

1409
01:21:48,982 --> 01:21:54,557
How with this one small TV channel
and a few unfortunate cameras

1410
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:58,823
an alternative, opposition picture was made.

1411
01:21:58,954 --> 01:22:04,688
And yet they managed to... At first,
they were all in scarves on the stage.

1412
01:22:04,713 --> 01:22:06,713
They then managed to argue.

1413
01:22:06,738 --> 01:22:08,230
Well, that's how it should be.

1414
01:22:08,255 --> 01:22:09,619
It's all-natural.

1415
01:22:09,644 --> 01:22:10,898
Everything goes naturally.

1416
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:15,372
No... Moreover... You
see, everyone was on time.

1417
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:19,073
Even Yanukovych was on time.

1418
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:25,175
Because if it hadn't been for Yanukovych,
I don't know what would have happened.

1419
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:30,200
If he hadn't shown striptease, completely all.

1420
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:32,200
And people...

1421
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:39,719
Not people, but some people were shocked and
understood that something needed to be taken by force.

1422
01:22:42,607 --> 01:22:46,200
So... But democratic
values were promised.

1423
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,200
Freedom was promised.

1424
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:53,200
The deprivation of clanhood was promised.

1425
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,023
The Orange Revolution.

1426
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,200
They became the government and kept the same thing.

1427
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,881
And then this clanhood... They
didn't keep anything, Natalka.

1428
01:23:01,968 --> 01:23:08,200
Ukrainian corruption, Ukrainian
clanhood are not in the Pechersk hills.

1429
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,200
Where?

1430
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:18,200
Because as long as we say that the fish rots from
the head, we will sit in the s**t where we sit.

1431
01:23:19,154 --> 01:23:22,673
Vasya Pupkin sits in the village.

1432
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:30,603
His brother Petya Pupkin
wins the election to the village head.

1433
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,603
Vasya Pupkin comes to Petya and says, listen, let me open
two shops, only don't give permission to open the third.

1434
01:23:37,628 --> 01:23:41,206
And then we will share everything
with you, and we will have it.

1435
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,708
From bottom to top,
all these conversations,

1436
01:23:45,732 --> 01:23:51,365
that somewhere the minister, or the president, or the
prime minister, or whoever steals something there.

1437
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:59,842
I want there to be no corruption, but I
want to be able to make an agreement quickly.

1438
01:24:00,978 --> 01:24:02,630
And this is how we live.

1439
01:24:02,655 --> 01:24:10,200
And maybe 10-20% of people don't give bribes.

1440
01:24:10,862 --> 01:24:15,200
If you come in, there are a lot
of people sitting and drinking beer.

1441
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,354
Saturday.

1442
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,750
In Tallinn.

1443
01:24:19,775 --> 01:24:20,544
We drink beer.

1444
01:24:20,569 --> 01:24:21,932
Veresen is getting late.

1445
01:24:23,472 --> 01:24:29,028
Half an hour after everyone has already
sat down he comes and apologizes and says,

1446
01:24:29,052 --> 01:24:35,200
listen, guys, I'm sorry, I was just stopped by
the police, I made a long deal, gave a bribe.

1447
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,888
Everyone says, well done, great.

1448
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,804
If I say that in Tallinn, no one will talk to me tomorrow.

1449
01:24:42,526 --> 01:24:45,200
If I say that in Warsaw, no one will talk to me tomorrow.

1450
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,347
I'm not talking about London.

1451
01:24:46,612 --> 01:24:51,125
And in Ukraine, well done, good boy.

1452
01:24:51,715 --> 01:24:54,200
And this is how 90% do it.

1453
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,200
Okay, 80%.

1454
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:00,200
After 2014, maybe after this war, it will be 75%.

1455
01:25:00,698 --> 01:25:04,553
But a huge majority, if they
criticize the government tomorrow,

1456
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:08,175
it's because they have no power.

1457
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,200
Critics of the government.

1458
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:15,588
When I look at some people, I won't call
their names,

1459
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:19,200
I look at how they describe the bad.

1460
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:31,200
They, damn it, sit in the Four Seasons hotel
and drive, damn it, on a Mercedes 600.

1461
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,200
And I see the saliva flowing from him.

1462
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
F**k, I want to be in his place.

1463
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,200
Four Seasons, I want, I want a Mercedes 600.

1464
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,200
There is.

1465
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,200
Yes.

1466
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:44,527
And they are very, very, very,
it is clear to them that this is jealousy.

1467
01:25:45,535 --> 01:25:49,908
And tomorrow that chief critic will say, damn it.

1468
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,200
Why?

1469
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,200
This is how it can be.

1470
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,710
I already a deputy minister there.

1471
01:25:54,813 --> 01:25:55,890
I know.

1472
01:25:57,036 --> 01:25:59,200
And this is not about nationalists.

1473
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,200
I knew, but I will not remind.

1474
01:26:01,225 --> 01:26:09,136
In 2004, how is it, these
energy resources were headed by

1475
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,225
the head of CUN, the Congress
of Ukrainian Nationalists.

1476
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,200
And what?

1477
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,200
And the same.

1478
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,204
And what?

1479
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:19,200
Not Slava Stetsko, no.

1480
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,200
And not her husband.

1481
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,200
But maybe Slava Stetsko would have said, no, no, no.

1482
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,845
Let's be somehow different.

1483
01:26:26,694 --> 01:26:32,200
So I am very careful with people who are the biggest critics.

1484
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
They don`t like everything.

1485
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,741
They just didn't give them pay.

1486
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:39,200
If they had given them pay, maybe they would have liked it more.

1487
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:47,175
There are some events when you worked on Channel
5 and we did the Orange Revolution together.

1488
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,200
Are you ashamed of your actions?

1489
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,200
I am ashamed every day.

1490
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,200
Every day.

1491
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,200
Orange Revolution.

1492
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,200
Tell me about the revolution.

1493
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,200
In fact, we were very envious of the people who came.

1494
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,200
It's demobilized.

1495
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,200
We work on Channel 5.

1496
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,200
Den Borisovich, Mr. Mykola, demobilized come.

1497
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,200
They have polished plaques.

1498
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
With our hands.

1499
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,200
And what?

1500
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,200
Yes.

1501
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,332
They come and tell them about responsibility.

1502
01:27:18,357 --> 01:27:19,200
I was triggered.

1503
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,200
Veresen is responsible.

1504
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,200
And I am always responsible.

1505
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:23,943
I tell.

1506
01:27:23,968 --> 01:27:24,968
It's 12 o'clock.

1507
01:27:24,993 --> 01:27:25,993
I make a change.

1508
01:27:26,018 --> 01:27:29,175
Verosen calls and says, I'm responsible.

1509
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,200
I can't come to the broadcast.

1510
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:35,200
And Moseychuk plays this broadcast until the night, until 12 o'clock.

1511
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
And I remember that day very well.

1512
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:41,200
But I brought out another fable.

1513
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,200
That you deserved it.

1514
01:27:43,896 --> 01:27:45,200
Well, maybe.

1515
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,200
And even you can afford it.

1516
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,200
Because you have done a lot before that.

1517
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,200
And you deserved it.

1518
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,200
It doesn't mean that you need to establish a grandfatherhood.

1519
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,200
No.

1520
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,200
I just don't want to...

1521
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,200
But I was humorous when Mykola came.

1522
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,200
Mykola has an assistant.

1523
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,200
Angela, yes.

1524
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,200
She was sitting at the keyboard.

1525
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,200
Mykola said, write.

1526
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,200
My name is Mykola Veresen.

1527
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,200
And then write yourself.

1528
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,200
No, it's not true.

1529
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,200
Well, it's true.

1530
01:28:14,225 --> 01:28:15,405
What am I going to lie about?

1531
01:28:15,469 --> 01:28:18,175
Let's call Angela right now.

1532
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
She will confirm or simplify.

1533
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,200
No.

1534
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,777
I know that I never
... I always don't ...

1535
01:28:25,802 --> 01:28:28,802
It's very difficult for me to read someone else's texts.

1536
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,200
It just doesn't work for me.

1537
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,200
I can't read someone else's texts.

1538
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,200
That's why I always write everything myself.

1539
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,200
And someone else can print it.

1540
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,200
That's another matter.

1541
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,200
But I always ... She printed it.

1542
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,200
But I always ... I never ... I just have
something ... I have physiological problems.

1543
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,200
I can't pronounce someone else's texts.

1544
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
I've never done that.

1545
01:28:48,713 --> 01:28:50,200
And moreover, I know for sure.

1546
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,200
I won't say the name.

1547
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:58,200
But I know for sure that after the
earlier broadcast, I changed all the texts.

1548
01:28:58,977 --> 01:29:00,200
And after me, no one changed.

1549
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,200
No one changed.

1550
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,200
No one changed the texts.

1551
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,200
They read my texts.

1552
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,200
There was a requirement to change 90% of the upgrade.

1553
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,200
Roman Skrypin set such a requirement then.

1554
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,200
And Andrii Shevchenko.

1555
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,200
No.

1556
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,200
Well, listen.

1557
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,200
No.

1558
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
This is really not deserved.

1559
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,200
I'll tell you one thing.

1560
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:22,502
When I came in 1990, it was the British days in Kyiv.

1561
01:29:22,867 --> 01:29:25,200
Basically, the BBC came to Kyiv then.

1562
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,200
And then I started to work tet-a-tet.

1563
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,200
Not through the phone.

1564
01:29:31,844 --> 01:29:33,200
I asked then.

1565
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,200
I say, in principle, you can calculate.

1566
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,200
I already understood the kitchen.

1567
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:42,995
That I ... Not that I
will say my opinion.

1568
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,164
Well, I'll hint.

1569
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
They say, well, yes.

1570
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,200
I say, and when?

1571
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,685
Well, 8-10 years.

1572
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,200
I still don't understand this word.

1573
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,200
Now, when I say it like that,
as you say, as many people say.

1574
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,200
And others, on the contrary, say this version is s**t.

1575
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,567
It is unknown who is right.

1576
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,550
When you are at home.

1577
01:30:07,224 --> 01:30:15,861
You can hint when you are so famous in the family.

1578
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:20,200
Which turns on the TV, computers, etc.

1579
01:30:20,829 --> 01:30:23,200
I ... Well, I know him.

1580
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,361
I have known him not for a year, and not two, and not three.

1581
01:30:27,472 --> 01:30:29,200
And he is at home with me.

1582
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,200
He is a family member.

1583
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,774
He is here somewhere with me.

1584
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,200
Then there are such moments.

1585
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,200
And when you are 25 years old, 35 years old.

1586
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,200
You came yesterday and you say.

1587
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:43,200
You need to take off this skirt,
but you have to wear green here.

1588
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:44,867
Who is he?

1589
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:49,200
When I have one program about fashion every day.

1590
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:53,200
And everyone knows that I have such a good taste.

1591
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,200
And I say, here you need green.

1592
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,200
And here you need red.

1593
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,200
And here you need yellow.

1594
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,200
And here you need
... Everyone says.

1595
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,200
Well, he is, in
principle ... Trust.

1596
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,200
Yes.

1597
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,200
In 10 cases, 8 he guessed.

1598
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,200
Okay.

1599
01:31:06,225 --> 01:31:08,225
We will both believe.

1600
01:31:08,969 --> 01:31:11,175
And if you came suddenly.

1601
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,820
You have been talking about cycling sports for a long time.

1602
01:31:13,845 --> 01:31:14,845
And then you came and said.

1603
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:17,050
Your skirt is not green.

1604
01:31:17,075 --> 01:31:18,822
You need here...

1605
01:31:19,727 --> 01:31:21,200
Are you talking about bicycles?

1606
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,200
Or about the skirt?

1607
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,200
Or about politics?

1608
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,669
Or about economics?

1609
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:27,564
Well, there was such dissatisfaction.

1610
01:31:27,589 --> 01:31:30,589
That is what we led them to.

1611
01:31:30,614 --> 01:31:31,614
I don't know.

1612
01:31:31,639 --> 01:31:35,175
Did you know that they did not have
consolidation in the orange team inside?

1613
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:39,955
Or did they all argue together along the way?

1614
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,980
Did you have dissatisfaction after the Universals?

1615
01:31:43,005 --> 01:31:44,573
After Timoshenko with Yanukovych?

1616
01:31:44,598 --> 01:31:45,598
No, no, no.

1617
01:31:45,623 --> 01:31:46,623
I had.

1618
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:48,175
I did not have the same dissatisfaction.

1619
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,200
I was worried.

1620
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,200
I was worried.

1621
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,709
But again, age.

1622
01:31:52,734 --> 01:31:53,734
Such an infection.

1623
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:54,759
This is age.

1624
01:31:55,359 --> 01:32:01,931
You know, I remember in 1992, when
Viktor Penzenyk did not resign somewhere.

1625
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:04,771
For the administration of Kuchma.

1626
01:32:04,796 --> 01:32:06,200
Kuchma was the prime minister.

1627
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,200
And something there.

1628
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,947
And I was so angry.

1629
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,527
Now I am ashamed.

1630
01:32:11,834 --> 01:32:13,175
For being angry then.

1631
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,200
And then I complained to him.

1632
01:32:15,535 --> 01:32:18,200
Because then it was...

1633
01:32:19,169 --> 01:32:21,932
Once we sat with Martinenko Sasha.

1634
01:32:21,957 --> 01:32:25,131
A beautiful phrase was born.

1635
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,200
About Balserovysh?

1636
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,200
Yes.

1637
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,200
You know, right?

1638
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,200
If Penzenyk lived in Poland.

1639
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,822
He would have been Balserovysh.

1640
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:36,290
If Balserovysh had lived in Ukraine.

1641
01:32:36,315 --> 01:32:37,718
He would have been Penzenyk.

1642
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:39,268
There are no options.

1643
01:32:39,293 --> 01:32:40,293
Just because.

1644
01:32:40,318 --> 01:32:43,175
Well, the country was ready.

1645
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,200
You say.

1646
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,200
It was possible there.

1647
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,200
It is possible.

1648
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,200
I said then, by the way.

1649
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,208
I said it then, too.

1650
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:53,755
If in 1991.

1651
01:32:54,605 --> 01:32:59,200
Then 52 million Ukrainians.

1652
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,200
All as one.

1653
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,915
Or at least two-thirds. Although three quarters is better.

1654
01:33:03,772 --> 01:33:09,708
They agreed as it was in
Estonia, in Poland, in Georgia,

1655
01:33:09,732 --> 01:33:17,816
without electricity, without water,
without heat, to live for 2-3 years.

1656
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:24,348
Maybe then we could
have kept nuclear weapons.

1657
01:33:24,372 --> 01:33:29,200
It was a very simple story. I saw
it all. I was at these negotiations.

1658
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,668
The Americans are sitting
and saying, give us weapons.

1659
01:33:32,692 --> 01:33:35,610
I'm vulgarizing, simplifying
as much as possible.

1660
01:33:35,961 --> 01:33:41,028
Here I have a billion, you have zero.

1661
01:33:41,052 --> 01:33:46,175
You have just zero. Here I have a
billion, and here I have an open hand.

1662
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:52,828
Put a bomb here for
me. All of you. Come on.

1663
01:33:52,852 --> 01:33:58,651
Find me a politician who says, I'm not going to tell the
nation, the people, but I'm going to convince the people.

1664
01:33:58,676 --> 01:34:06,175
Let's clench our teeth and we'll
be hungry for 3 years. Without electricity.

1665
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:09,200
Well, it happened. Without electricity, but without you. Without heat.

1666
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:16,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. With electricity,
with heat, everything worked. Everything.

1667
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:20,048
I say it caught up with us.

1668
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:23,028
When Zelensky comes out now and
says, we need electricity but without you.

1669
01:34:23,052 --> 01:34:25,200
Without heat, but without you, Russians.

1670
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:28,770
Well, listen, it caught up. It's the 24th.

1671
01:34:28,795 --> 01:34:33,468
I was sitting on the 24th of August 1991

1672
01:34:33,492 --> 01:34:38,108
in the halls of the Verkhovna
Rada, up there, and next to me

1673
01:34:38,132 --> 01:34:44,200
was Kulik, the future
Minister of Information, Zinoviy.

1674
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,200
Vitaliy Kulik.

1675
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,200
No, Zinoviy.

1676
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,200
Zinoviy Kulik.

1677
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,715
We were sitting there by accident.

1678
01:34:52,678 --> 01:34:54,446
And so they vote,

1679
01:34:54,470 --> 01:35:00,426
there are 361 or 362, and the
decision is made. Kravchuk, everything...

1680
01:35:01,589 --> 01:35:03,267
So, there will be blood.

1681
01:35:05,388 --> 01:35:08,465
And this was not my emotion.

1682
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:13,029
It is jus that, as a historian, I am a terrible
historian. I cannot say that I am a great historian.

1683
01:35:13,205 --> 01:35:18,168
But I just saw some patterns there a little, read something sometimes.

1684
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,640
And he says … why?

1685
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:26,200
I say because, well, freedom is not given free.

1686
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:38,795
Now, after 2004, I said this phrase that
the currency paid for freedom is called blood.

1687
01:35:40,092 --> 01:35:42,046
Freedom does not accept other currencies.

1688
01:35:44,247 --> 01:35:45,795
This is the only currency.

1689
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:50,253
And when you were given it for free in 1991,

1690
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,200
then they started to remind me, no,
and 100 years ago, and Bandera, and this.

1691
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,906
I say, no, no, you have to be here and now.

1692
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:03,182
You have to start the process today

1693
01:36:03,206 --> 01:36:08,200
and constantly lead it, maybe for
decades, but starting from today.

1694
01:36:08,551 --> 01:36:10,200
And then it is counted.

1695
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:17,200
If you started 100 years ago and
lost 90 years, it is not counted.

1696
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,200
So we started in 1991.

1697
01:36:19,485 --> 01:36:21,200
Then we continued in 2004.

1698
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,200
Then we continued in 2014.

1699
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,670
Now in 2022.

1700
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:32,107
And when we get the case to
the end, then we will have freedom.

1701
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:41,141
As wise people say, the case is not
over until it is not over correctly.

1702
01:36:42,844 --> 01:36:44,200
It is not over?

1703
01:36:44,566 --> 01:36:46,685
Ours is not over yet.

1704
01:36:48,041 --> 01:36:50,041
And the right thing is Ukraine.

1705
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,200
In the European Union, in NATO.

1706
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,200
Fully.

1707
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:58,200
That is, even if now Ukraine enters with parts as some propose.

1708
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,200
Are you now?

1709
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,200
I do not mind.

1710
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,200
By the way, I do not see any nightmare here.

1711
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,200
I am GDR, FRG.

1712
01:37:06,116 --> 01:37:07,175
Nothing.

1713
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,200
A wonderful story.

1714
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,200
You have to at least put your foot in there.

1715
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:15,200
In the door, you know, so that they do not close.

1716
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:17,200
Well, I want everything immediately.

1717
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,200
We are Ukrainians, after all.

1718
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,200
Ukrainians, everything is immediate.

1719
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,200
We do not need these parts.

1720
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,200
Therefore, it will be interesting.

1721
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:28,200
I do not exclude any options.

1722
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,200
You know, I do not exclude.

1723
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,269
I understand that there may be good
options, average options, and bad options.

1724
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,200
And if the bad option is what will happen to the people?

1725
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,555
As you say.

1726
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:42,968
If we have to forget about the borders of 1991.

1727
01:37:42,993 --> 01:37:44,541
Why forget?

1728
01:37:44,811 --> 01:37:45,811
Why forget?

1729
01:37:45,836 --> 01:37:47,175
Well, the Baltics too.

1730
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:51,352
Listen, we have a wonderful example called Finland.

1731
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,987
In the 1940s, it had completely different borders.

1732
01:37:55,376 --> 01:37:59,200
Russia, or rather the Soviet Union, took the territories and still lives there.

1733
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:01,200
But they kept themselves.

1734
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:07,200
They kept Finland, the Finnish language,
Finnish culture, Finnish economy.

1735
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,004
They kept themselves.

1736
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:15,200
Ukraine, I said it in March 2022.

1737
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:24,200
If there are three regions left, then Putin has lost.

1738
01:38:25,052 --> 01:38:29,973
Because his goal is not to have any
region, but for everything to be Russia.

1739
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,200
That's all.

1740
01:38:31,513 --> 01:38:34,632
But if you ... How to say?

1741
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,625
Do you understand?

1742
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:44,200
Now the artificial intelligence
was sent to...

1743
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,200
How to solve these crises, crisis problems.

1744
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,200
And the whole artificial intelligence says, let's throw a bomb.

1745
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:54,200
We have it, but if we have a bomb, why don't we use it?

1746
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,729
Let's throw it.

1747
01:38:57,195 --> 01:39:04,200
The military always operates on the worst scenarios.

1748
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,270
Just the worst.

1749
01:39:07,763 --> 01:39:12,556
And I also operate on the best, the worst, and the average.

1750
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:14,266
I have my friends there, foreigners.

1751
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:17,992
They say, well, listen, it can't be forever.

1752
01:39:18,017 --> 01:39:24,934
I say that is, here is a Canadian, a Brit, a German.

1753
01:39:26,318 --> 01:39:27,908
The war is going on.

1754
01:39:27,933 --> 01:39:30,862
They supply arms in one way or another.

1755
01:39:30,887 --> 01:39:33,887
Ammunition, money there, everything.

1756
01:39:34,413 --> 01:39:38,227
The war is going on for a year, two, three, five.

1757
01:39:38,486 --> 01:39:40,486
How long does it take for it to go?

1758
01:39:42,041 --> 01:39:45,041
Without the victory of Ukraine and without the victory of Russia.

1759
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:47,753
And? How many?

1760
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:56,200
And sooner or later, a German,
an Austrian, a Canadian, an American.

1761
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,200
They`ll sit - let's end it. Under any circumstances.

1762
01:39:59,846 --> 01:40:02,799
With Crimea, without Crimea, so and so.

1763
01:40:04,047 --> 01:40:06,877
Are we excluding it 100%?

1764
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,200
I wouldn't say so.

1765
01:40:10,219 --> 01:40:13,473
That's why I think we have all the options on the table for now.

1766
01:40:14,322 --> 01:40:18,200
Of course, Ukrainians want to have a good option.

1767
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,200
What can you say to the people?

1768
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,200
We need to talk for a long time.

1769
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:27,200
Especially those who...
This is a matter of fine matter.

1770
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:35,200
Because we can talk like some politicians.

1771
01:40:35,806 --> 01:40:39,200
And we can talk shorter.

1772
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:43,200
The question is always the language.

1773
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,200
If we have a question, who will talk to the people?

1774
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,200
It's like mobilization.

1775
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,200
We have an elected president.

1776
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,331
We have a government.

1777
01:40:50,356 --> 01:40:55,175
And they have to gradually and gradually
say that there is such and such an option.

1778
01:40:55,200 --> 01:41:00,200
Now Zelensky's position, as I understand it, I don't know.

1779
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,371
I didn't hold a candle.

1780
01:41:01,786 --> 01:41:04,786
We need optimism and patriotism.

1781
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:06,811
And I'm not saying it's bad or good.

1782
01:41:06,836 --> 01:41:07,836
I don't comment on it.

1783
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:09,561
Because he's the president.

1784
01:41:09,586 --> 01:41:10,966
I'm not the president.

1785
01:41:12,175 --> 01:41:14,175
That's what he thinks.

1786
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:17,200
Okay, maybe he has more information.

1787
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:17,799
No.

1788
01:41:17,824 --> 01:41:19,824
He definitely has more information than I do.

1789
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,200
Let him see it that way.

1790
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:30,200
Now the question is, if Trump wins, 
will anything change or nothing?

1791
01:41:30,972 --> 01:41:35,155
If they give these 60 billion or not,

1792
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:40,837
will we withstand the pressure on the front or not?

1793
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Can we mobilize, well, okay, not
500,000, but 400,000, okay, 300,000?

1794
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,163
Or can we not?

1795
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,200
That's just a question.

1796
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,200
Do you think that the conversation with the country,

1797
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,200
if the government comes out and says
that we do not withstand the pressure

1798
01:41:57,200 --> 01:42:03,640
and we will stop in deep defense, will
it end with the consolidation of society

1799
01:42:03,665 --> 01:42:10,175
and the preservation of that part of
Ukraine that was liberated from the Russians?

1800
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:14,200
Difficult. The conversation will not be easy.

1801
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:17,200
Will the country survive after this conversation?

1802
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:22,200
Listen, our problem, the problem of Ukrainians is that,

1803
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:29,200
and, by the way, journalists, and you, and
me, it is that we, looking at social networks,

1804
01:42:30,313 --> 01:42:39,200
see there are 3-5, a maximum of 7 percent,
but so active, who are constantly shouting,

1805
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:42,980
everything is gone, they take
off their clothes, the client leaves.

1806
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,200
Do you think it's 3-5 percent of them?

1807
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,200
I don't think so, I'm talking to sociologists.

1808
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:51,200
I'm talking to sociologists on purpose.

1809
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,964
People are much wiser, they just keep silent.

1810
01:42:53,989 --> 01:42:56,989
Those who are wiser, who are 80 percent, they keep silent.

1811
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,464
And those who speak from morning to
night, that everyone around is guilty,

1812
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:05,551
there are 3-5, a maximum of 7 of them.

1813
01:43:05,576 --> 01:43:10,200
But there are so many of them,
they are so bright, they shout so loudly.

1814
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,200
Natalka, it's all right, Ukrainians are not such idiots.

1815
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,426
Although there are, they happen, there are, there are.

1816
01:43:16,672 --> 01:43:20,200
That is, you don't have such a feeling of
a deep split in Ukrainian society?

1817
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,200
There is nothing close, there is nothing close.

1818
01:43:23,886 --> 01:43:28,200
And in Lviv, where you live, there is no such thing either?

1819
01:43:29,014 --> 01:43:31,200
Listen, there are different people everywhere.

1820
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:37,396
That is, here I am, we began to donate less.

1821
01:43:37,421 --> 01:43:39,200
I'm talking to the banks.

1822
01:43:39,943 --> 01:43:42,200
Well, Gorokhovsky came out and said more, yes.

1823
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:46,200
In one and a half times, the 2023 year gave more than the 2022.

1824
01:43:47,205 --> 01:43:49,200
What kind of nonsense is this?

1825
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:52,200
Someone, to someone, one woman,
the woman said, as they say about the BBC.

1826
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:58,562
Here I read, everyone stopped speaking
the Ukrainian language, back to Russian.

1827
01:43:58,587 --> 01:44:00,873
We didn`t all speak totally Ukrainian,

1828
01:44:00,898 --> 01:44:03,898
in the 2022 year we suddenly had such a magical tummler.

1829
01:44:04,672 --> 01:44:06,918
And 100% speaks Ukrainian.

1830
01:44:06,943 --> 01:44:09,943
No, they will speak Russian for a long time.

1831
01:44:10,652 --> 01:44:13,200
There are places where they will speak.

1832
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,200
And you will not go anywhere.

1833
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,200
You will not do anything with it.

1834
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,200
Nature is like that.

1835
01:44:19,665 --> 01:44:21,200
This is how we lived.

1836
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,200
So I don`t see any splits.

1837
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:27,200
Yes, I think I can greet the Kremlin.

1838
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,200
Because this is gradual.

1839
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,200
Here it is bad, here it is bad.

1840
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,200
Everyone shouted.

1841
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,200
They take off their clothes and leave.

1842
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,200
And that's it.

1843
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,200
You know, it's probably the age.

1844
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:43,200
I have long said that everyone who is on the stage,

1845
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:46,200
they all need them, Ukraine needs them.

1846
01:44:47,088 --> 01:44:49,200
The nation itself will choose.

1847
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,200
These are elections.

1848
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,596
We can't do anything about it.

1849
01:44:52,621 --> 01:44:58,175
When they started..., I read today that
some idiots, I will not say their names,

1850
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,200
they were very serious idiots.

1851
01:45:00,826 --> 01:45:02,200
Usurpation of power.

1852
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:09,200
I say, listen, the people came and said,
this guy has 73%, these guys have 50%.

1853
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:11,200
23% and 70%.

1854
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,200
No, no, no.

1855
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,200
I'm not talking about the parliament.

1856
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,200
There are 50% and something.

1857
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:19,772
Well, let's cancel it all.

1858
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:21,200
Well, that's what happened.

1859
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,200
People voted like that.

1860
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,200
This is bad.

1861
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,200
Well, bad.

1862
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,200
I don't know.

1863
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,200
But these are people, not me.

1864
01:45:28,789 --> 01:45:31,200
I, for example, didn't vote for it.

1865
01:45:32,782 --> 01:45:38,200
But I, well, if it's a democracy, do I have to
agree with the majority or what should I do?

1866
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,892
How should I behave?

1867
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,200
Raise the revolution every five years.

1868
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,200
Because I don't like this president.

1869
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,200
I don't like this council.

1870
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,200
I don't like this prime minister.

1871
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,036
I don't like these people at all.

1872
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:52,061
Churchill told us that it was very bad.

1873
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,200
Democracy is very, very, very imperfect.

1874
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,790
It's better to come up with something.

1875
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,200
Let's do it like in Moscow.

1876
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,107
Everything is fine there.

1877
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:03,175
The man came and said, here you
will be like this, walk as I said.

1878
01:46:03,413 --> 01:46:04,678
And that's it.

1879
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:09,925
And by the way, a lot of people, these
7%, about whom I said, this is their dream.

1880
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,200
I'm just saying,
what are they for?

1881
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,200
They are for democracy.

1882
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,200
No, no, no.

1883
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,474
They want everyone to be like them.

1884
01:46:18,025 --> 01:46:20,025
They want everyone to be.

1885
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:23,200
They don't just write, I think.

1886
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,200
People need.

1887
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,200
Yes.

1888
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,839
They always have a people.

1889
01:46:27,864 --> 01:46:28,864
People.

1890
01:46:29,857 --> 01:46:34,751
Savonarola was like that in Florence.

1891
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:43,839
Everyone remembers great artists, sculptors,
but there was Savonarola, who was like that.

1892
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:46,864
He had a lot of young
guys, very young.

1893
01:46:46,889 --> 01:46:50,889
And they just destroyed,
attacked, killed.

1894
01:46:50,914 --> 01:46:54,914
It would be good to destroy, to
attack, to kill, but not during the war.

1895
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:59,200
And so, when I asked
you, do you feel the split?

1896
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,200
I'm very triggered.

1897
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,200
I won't hide it.

1898
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:05,200
And I'm always worried about such movements.

1899
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,200
And especially this
one, the last discourse.

1900
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,200
I don't know.

1901
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,200
Of course, when we go
on air, I think it will end.

1902
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:18,032
But nevertheless, I think it's quite
dangerous when politicians separate people

1903
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,200
along the lines of Zaluzhny and Zelensky.

1904
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:21,200
Just a second.

1905
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,200
It will happen.

1906
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,200
What luck for the Russians.

1907
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,200
It happens.

1908
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,098
People remain people.

1909
01:47:27,123 --> 01:47:28,123
You can't go anywhere.

1910
01:47:28,148 --> 01:47:29,837
There will be scandals.

1911
01:47:29,862 --> 01:47:37,041
People have gathered during the beginning
of the war, as always, in a new affair.

1912
01:47:37,127 --> 01:47:39,127
This is not even a military affair.

1913
01:47:39,152 --> 01:47:41,264
You asked about 1+1.

1914
01:47:41,289 --> 01:47:49,670
When 1+1 appeared,
everyone was burning brightly.

1915
01:47:50,138 --> 01:47:51,671
No one wanted to make a mistake.

1916
01:47:51,696 --> 01:47:53,491
Everyone was next to each other.

1917
01:47:53,516 --> 01:47:55,200
Everyone was holding on to each other.

1918
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:59,200
Come on, we will now prove that
Ukrainians can do great television.

1919
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,200
Let's find such and such.

1920
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:03,200
Let's find this type.

1921
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,200
All together.

1922
01:48:04,843 --> 01:48:05,843
A year passes.

1923
01:48:05,868 --> 01:48:07,256
Two passes.

1924
01:48:07,586 --> 01:48:08,586
That's it.

1925
01:48:08,754 --> 01:48:09,754
It ends.

1926
01:48:09,882 --> 01:48:10,882
It ends.

1927
01:48:11,677 --> 01:48:13,070
By the way, I don't know.

1928
01:48:13,095 --> 01:48:17,044
I don't have either. I don't have my point of view. I see a lot...

1929
01:48:17,069 --> 01:48:19,538
In general,

1930
01:48:19,562 --> 01:48:24,355
I would say that this Zelensky-Zaluzhny is
such, in fact, it is a very simple story.

1931
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:31,037
This is a story about the fact that
two people have about 95% in common.

1932
01:48:32,469 --> 01:48:37,576
But through our colleagues, through me, through
you, through everyone, through many, many,

1933
01:48:37,601 --> 01:48:44,392
and those who write on the Internet, we,
these 5%, became so important that they are

1934
01:48:44,417 --> 01:48:46,417
more important than 95%.

1935
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,988
Imagine that someone wants to lose,

1936
01:48:53,012 --> 01:48:57,304
does not want money
from America, someone does not want weapons

1937
01:48:57,329 --> 01:49:03,074
from America, someone
does not want Putin to die.

1938
01:49:04,185 --> 01:49:08,200
If you take and calculate how much they
have in common, then in common they are

1939
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:09,200
like this.

1940
01:49:10,526 --> 01:49:12,901
And differently,
they are like this.

1941
01:49:13,298 --> 01:49:15,008
And they shout about it.

1942
01:49:15,436 --> 01:49:18,669
And so according to all
parameters, you just need to be calm.

1943
01:49:18,694 --> 01:49:24,722
Here I am, as it is called, when there
are commissariats, now there are some

1944
01:49:24,747 --> 01:49:25,747
three letters.

1945
01:49:25,978 --> 01:49:26,659
TCK.

1946
01:49:26,684 --> 01:49:27,684
TCK.

1947
01:49:28,494 --> 01:49:34,494
I think on purpose, I am so smart
that I always dig into everything.

1948
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:40,481
Scandals on the
fingers of one hand.

1949
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:44,552
Something in Odesa,
something in Zakarpattia.

1950
01:49:44,577 --> 01:49:45,982
Well, such a thing.

1951
01:49:46,007 --> 01:49:47,453
And how many TCKs?

1952
01:49:47,929 --> 01:49:48,929
Hundreds.

1953
01:49:49,723 --> 01:49:51,723
It is less than a percent.

1954
01:49:52,743 --> 01:49:58,104
And the scandal is such that it is so
impressive that all TCKs are just fighting

1955
01:49:58,129 --> 01:50:02,731
on the heads of poor people on the street
and them in this immediate jail

1956
01:50:02,756 --> 01:50:04,501
and after jail
on the front.

1957
01:50:05,779 --> 01:50:10,886
Then somewhere I read Oh, 20,000

1958
01:50:10,911 --> 01:50:13,614
people were
detained on the border.

1959
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:15,820
20,000!

1960
01:50:15,844 --> 01:50:17,813
There is a million in the front.

1961
01:50:17,837 --> 01:50:21,142
20,000 is two f**king percent.

1962
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:26,731
That's much less than
in any army in the world.

1963
01:50:27,588 --> 01:50:32,642
Because those who want to go
through the war are much more.

1964
01:50:34,652 --> 01:50:40,394
Someone calculated how many
people were going freely to the front.

1965
01:50:40,925 --> 01:50:42,925
I talked with people from the front line.

1966
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:47,654
They say we have queues. 
But we don`t know about that.

1967
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,669
We know that there is Vasya Pupkin who
said that he doesn't want to join the army.

1968
01:50:51,694 --> 01:50:56,231
And all newspapers, radio, TV, the
Internet wrote about Vasya Pupkin.

1969
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:01,809
And the fact that there are 150 other people
who say that they are going to the front.

1970
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:04,780
No, we don't know about it.

1971
01:51:05,306 --> 01:51:06,410
And this is everywhere.

1972
01:51:06,435 --> 01:51:09,079
Because we know about the louder ones.

1973
01:51:09,104 --> 01:51:15,841
And we know how those who shout
the loudest can take advantage of technology.

1974
01:51:16,081 --> 01:51:21,912
And to come to power on a grader
and then do what happened before him.

1975
01:51:23,383 --> 01:51:26,290
Well, people
don't really change.

1976
01:51:26,315 --> 01:51:28,942
I said at the beginning that
they change and don't change.

1977
01:51:28,967 --> 01:51:31,746
We can't find any...

1978
01:51:31,771 --> 01:51:35,595
It's just that these people
convince the country that it will be different.

1979
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:37,775
Listen, if they won't convert,

1980
01:51:37,799 --> 01:51:40,669
then let's surrender to the Russians,
because no one is convincing anyone there.

1981
01:51:40,701 --> 01:51:42,345
If they convince the country...

1982
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:45,895
They will not be convinced.

1983
01:51:46,374 --> 01:51:47,947
There aren`t so many of them.

1984
01:51:48,406 --> 01:51:52,012
But this is a big challenge.

1985
01:51:52,279 --> 01:51:56,241
On the one hand, you can't
support it because there is a war.

1986
01:51:56,266 --> 01:52:02,722
On the other hand, you can't close the mouse to
everyone, because why we`re fighting then?

1987
01:52:02,747 --> 01:52:05,226
Because in Russia
everyone's mouse is closed.

1988
01:52:05,643 --> 01:52:08,228
Then let's give up right away
and everything will be fine.

1989
01:52:08,252 --> 01:52:10,516
They're closed, we're
closed. There is no difference.

1990
01:52:10,766 --> 01:52:12,446
So you have to criticize.

1991
01:52:12,471 --> 01:52:14,933
So you think we can win with our mouths open?

1992
01:52:15,929 --> 01:52:22,935
Well, listen, democracy
always wins at a long distance.

1993
01:52:24,736 --> 01:52:29,437
So, you need to take your own hands
and understand that it won't end tomorrow.

1994
01:52:31,493 --> 01:52:34,012
Otherwise, it will
be bad for everyone.

1995
01:52:34,037 --> 01:52:36,581
You can't escape from this. It`ll be bad for everyone.

1996
01:52:36,606 --> 01:52:40,894
Should the government now say what kind of
country we are building? Right now, during the war.

1997
01:52:41,484 --> 01:52:45,689
There are such desires, but no one knows what to build the country.

1998
01:52:45,714 --> 01:52:47,250
Nobody knows.

1999
01:52:47,275 --> 01:52:49,260
There are such images of Europe.

2000
01:52:49,841 --> 01:52:55,878
Although Europe, you know, Sweden is Europe,
Portugal is Europe, Greece is Europe, Austria is Europe.

2001
01:52:55,903 --> 01:53:04,023
The origins of the foreign media say that Washington
asks Kyiv what would you do at the front line?

2002
01:53:04,048 --> 01:53:06,149
What kind of country are you going to build?

2003
01:53:06,174 --> 01:53:08,853
No, no, these are two different issues.

2004
01:53:08,877 --> 01:53:11,520
I have already painted
a picture at the front.

2005
01:53:11,544 --> 01:53:15,373
The story at the front is complicated
because there are no obvious things.

2006
01:53:17,031 --> 01:53:25,323
If the front will stand for a long time,
sooner or later they will say let's find a way to make peace.

2007
01:53:25,937 --> 01:53:29,908
Does this mean that
the conditional Zelensky

2008
01:53:29,932 --> 01:53:34,363
will be replaced by some party of
peace or the Minsk agreements?

2009
01:53:34,388 --> 01:53:37,093
Or Zelensky will mimic.

2010
01:53:37,823 --> 01:53:38,928
Thanks.

2011
01:53:38,953 --> 01:53:44,272
Or Zelensky, who is quite an elastic person, I think.

2012
01:53:44,848 --> 01:53:47,611
I think he can.

2013
01:53:47,636 --> 01:53:50,875
Now he may not have such thoughts.
Although I think there are.

2014
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:57,004
I even sometimes think that this whole story
with Zaluzhny is not because it's between them,

2015
01:53:57,194 --> 01:54:00,170
but that we need to come up with a new vector.

2016
01:54:00,784 --> 01:54:06,242
Have you read the leaks from
the foreign press, where they say that...?

2017
01:54:06,698 --> 01:54:09,508
I just got a call from
a friend from Toronto

2018
01:54:09,532 --> 01:54:12,508
who is going to make a
movie and we had a long talk

2019
01:54:12,532 --> 01:54:19,206
about what the mood of Americans,
Europeans can be and so on.

2020
01:54:19,231 --> 01:54:23,505
And it's such a ...
We talked with him.

2021
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:28,348
The only drawback of our conversation...this
is my old friend from CBC,

2022
01:54:28,372 --> 01:54:35,341
is that we counted only Ukrainians,
we haven`t counted Russians.

2023
01:54:36,634 --> 01:54:39,648
And we should count both Ukrainians and Russians.

2024
01:54:41,764 --> 01:54:47,861
Therefore, failures can befall both us and the Russians.

2025
01:54:48,238 --> 01:54:52,427
In the long, it will be much worse for Russians.

2026
01:54:53,957 --> 01:55:02,745
But then again, it's hard for me to imagine...
I've been saying since 1989 that I'm a democrat...

2027
01:55:03,275 --> 01:55:07,934
For me, democracy is important and I
understand that it is a value that we must fight for.

2028
01:55:07,959 --> 01:55:12,388
If there is no democracy, if
there is no criticism, if there is no

2029
01:55:12,412 --> 01:55:17,220
freedom of speech and freedom of
the press, then what are we fighting for?

2030
01:55:18,022 --> 01:55:21,752
I think we are fighting for freedom,
freedom of speech, freedom of the press.

2031
01:55:21,777 --> 01:55:25,468
And on the other hand, there is also a
contradiction in that

2032
01:55:25,492 --> 01:55:29,786
I don't like a lot of what I hear.

2033
01:55:30,114 --> 01:55:36,308
But this does not mean that I believe
that people, as you say, have been split.

2034
01:55:36,332 --> 01:55:38,944
That it is a 50-50 split.

2035
01:55:39,421 --> 01:55:41,890
It's 1 in 10.

2036
01:55:42,794 --> 01:55:44,794
And so I am more or less calm.

2037
01:55:45,857 --> 01:55:51,946
But what should we do? Ban freedom of speech? No.

2038
01:55:52,034 --> 01:55:55,348
Well, I'm just afraid of 1919,
100 years ago, you know,

2039
01:55:55,372 --> 01:55:57,756
but I would never have thought, Mr. Mykola,

2040
01:55:57,781 --> 01:56:07,679
that you could say this phrase that
Kravchuk did and Zelensky is doing one fundamental thing.

2041
01:56:07,704 --> 01:56:14,028
Kravchuk was pulling the
Ukrainian Republic out of the USSR,

2042
01:56:14,052 --> 01:56:21,486
and Zelensky is pulling Ukraine out of the
Ukrainian republic that was created after 1991.

2043
01:56:21,511 --> 01:56:26,908
One more point from Kravchuk...,
it's too early to talk about Zelensky,

2044
01:56:26,932 --> 01:56:31,262
it will take some time for
us to understand the history.

2045
01:56:31,902 --> 01:56:40,111
But what we forget is the peaceful
change of power from Kravchuk to Kuchma.

2046
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:44,298
Zelensky did the same thing. He succeeded, despite the...

2047
01:56:44,323 --> 01:56:54,430
At first, these are all the consequences
of that sunny summer day, I remember it,

2048
01:56:54,804 --> 01:57:00,148
where we stood and I remember
now with Oleksandr Martynenko

2049
01:57:00,172 --> 01:57:03,291
in the Mariinsky Palace
and saw how it was changing.

2050
01:57:03,553 --> 01:57:06,881
We didn't pay that much attention to it at the time.

2051
01:57:07,486 --> 01:57:09,668
And now I realize that

2052
01:57:09,692 --> 01:57:18,644
the transition of power was laid down to
be difficult, but not like in Central Asia.

2053
01:57:18,669 --> 01:57:22,283
It was laid down, but it failed twice.
During the Orange Revolution and in 2014.

2054
01:57:22,308 --> 01:57:25,724
It failed, but the case was completed
anyway because it was completed correctly.

2055
01:57:26,398 --> 01:57:31,588
It's just always, as they say,
offensive, and especially in 2013-2014

2056
01:57:31,612 --> 01:57:35,055
because people are dead, you know?

2057
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:40,053
And then history rolled back all the demands of the revolution.

2058
01:57:40,078 --> 01:57:46,776
Listen, we talked about paying for
freedom with blood. Nothing can be done.

2059
01:57:46,801 --> 01:57:50,547
Other currencies are not accepted.
This cash desk does not accept other currencies.

2060
01:57:51,331 --> 01:57:56,490
In a cash register called freedom... So everything is organic.

2061
01:57:57,652 --> 01:58:01,208
It hurts because it was in
front of our eyes, you know?

2062
01:58:01,232 --> 01:58:09,028
And if we look at the Polish
events, the partition of Poland, 1792...

2063
01:58:09,052 --> 01:58:11,497
everyone went through this.

2064
01:58:12,163 --> 01:58:14,188
Just because it's in front of our eyes,

2065
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:16,628
and because there was a bombing last night,

2066
01:58:16,652 --> 01:58:21,908
and someone died, and terrible things are
happening, so yes,

2067
01:58:21,932 --> 01:58:23,877
we are living in such a period.

2068
01:58:23,938 --> 01:58:27,266
I didn't expect to see you like this, to be honest.

2069
01:58:27,997 --> 01:58:29,076
What am I supposed to be like?

2070
01:58:29,076 --> 01:58:33,973
No, I remember Mykola Veresen as quite emotional...

2071
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:38,468
You know, I'm changing too,

2072
01:58:38,492 --> 01:58:42,148
and I generally think that people
who don't change are called idiots.

2073
01:58:42,728 --> 01:58:47,988
I think I would have come to the
Maidan if I had seen such a nightmare,

2074
01:58:48,012 --> 01:58:49,649
but I didn't see a nightmare.

2075
01:58:49,938 --> 01:58:56,212
I actually think we chose all this back in 2022 in March.

2076
01:58:57,427 --> 01:59:01,668
So my version is that as long as

2077
01:59:01,692 --> 01:59:11,577
the Ukrainian leadership doesn't call
Moscow, as long as this country is alive.

2078
01:59:11,998 --> 01:59:16,548
Moreover, tomorrow or the
day after tomorrow I will be

2079
01:59:16,572 --> 01:59:20,332
talking about this with
friends, various intellectuals.

2080
01:59:21,111 --> 01:59:24,375
It turns out that the institutions are very strong.

2081
01:59:25,722 --> 01:59:29,548
They're not perfect,
they're not perfect, but listen,

2082
01:59:29,572 --> 01:59:34,825
I didn't believe that we would
survive. I didn't believe it.

2083
01:59:35,405 --> 01:59:36,405
Question.

2084
01:59:37,333 --> 01:59:40,597
We have people who listened carefully, our viewers.

2085
01:59:40,622 --> 01:59:41,622
Right?

2086
01:59:41,647 --> 01:59:44,206
We have a format where the audience asks questions

2087
01:59:44,231 --> 01:59:45,351
Let them ask.

2088
01:59:47,834 --> 01:59:49,801
Good evening. My name is Alexander.

2089
01:59:49,825 --> 01:59:54,972
Please tell us if you have any of your
previous projects from the 90s and 00s

2090
01:59:54,996 --> 01:59:58,622
that you would like to return to
and how you would modernize them.

2091
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:03,270
No, I don't have any, I'm
thinking about new projects.

2092
02:00:03,294 --> 02:00:09,720
If I had the money, if a billion fell from
the sky, I would make a fantastic channel.

2093
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:15,308
But I understand that a billion won't fall

2094
02:00:15,332 --> 02:00:19,255
and I'm not going to update
anything because I've already done it,

2095
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:22,326
I'm not interested, I
already know how to do it.

2096
02:00:22,644 --> 02:00:26,402
But what is new, I don't know,
maybe I could come up with something,

2097
02:00:26,426 --> 02:00:31,278
but today I don't think about it,
I think that there is a war now,

2098
02:00:31,302 --> 02:00:34,580
and God willing, we will stay where we are.

2099
02:00:35,615 --> 02:00:41,636
I go to work and tell people what is happening
at the front, in the rear, here and there.

2100
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:46,783
I think it's a great
mission, and I'm doing it.

2101
02:00:47,145 --> 02:00:50,326
And now I think, oh,
what would have happened

2102
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:56,338
if there was no war, if
I had a billion, if, if, if...

2103
02:00:56,363 --> 02:01:01,099
If my grandmother had a mustache and
a beard, she would be a grandfather.

2104
02:01:02,823 --> 02:01:03,823
Thank you.

2105
02:01:07,196 --> 02:01:12,887
Good evening, Mr. Mykola, my name
is Roman. You mentioned democratic values.

2106
02:01:12,975 --> 02:01:15,994
Actually, this is what distinguishes us
 from Russians, what we are fighting for.

2107
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:19,748
And I want to ask you about
freedom of speech during the war.

2108
02:01:19,772 --> 02:01:26,588
What should it be like? Who
should determine its limits, if any?

2109
02:01:26,612 --> 02:01:29,928
And where should we stop?

2110
02:01:29,953 --> 02:01:34,148
That is, can we, as media, as mass media,

2111
02:01:34,172 --> 02:01:38,295
inform society, for example,
about our losses, what they really are?

2112
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:46,268
There is no answer to your question,

2113
02:01:46,292 --> 02:01:49,645
it does not exist in nature. There
is no answer to this question.

2114
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:57,081
I have this rather provocative idea...

2115
02:01:58,486 --> 02:02:02,685
I was just asked this question

2116
02:02:02,709 --> 02:02:09,508
when the greatest chief of the
BBC came to Kyiv many years ago.

2117
02:02:09,532 --> 02:02:14,057
We were sitting in a restaurant
and this is always asked.

2118
02:02:18,849 --> 02:02:26,788
On June 3, 1944, you are a journalist

2119
02:02:26,812 --> 02:02:34,895
and you find out that there will be an
Anglo-American, Canadian landing in Normandy.

2120
02:02:38,133 --> 02:02:40,868
And you are a journalist,

2121
02:02:40,892 --> 02:02:45,577
you cannot hide information
and you have to write about it.

2122
02:02:45,626 --> 02:02:49,988
Today, on the 3rd, you wrote about
it, tomorrow Hitler will find out about it,

2123
02:02:50,012 --> 02:02:51,617
and the day after tomorrow
all these people will die.

2124
02:02:53,562 --> 02:02:55,242
What are your actions?

2125
02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:01,089
There's a nice positive story,
you'll laugh because it's absurd,

2126
02:03:01,113 --> 02:03:03,943
but it's the only thing
the BBC came up with.

2127
02:03:05,007 --> 02:03:07,988
That I write

2128
02:03:08,012 --> 02:03:15,864
and describe information beautifully, and
you, the editor, do not put it on the air.

2129
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:21,254
I did my job as a journalist, 
and you did yours as an editor.

2130
02:03:21,429 --> 02:03:24,668
It goes without saying
that this is not a solution.

2131
02:03:24,692 --> 02:03:29,770
But it is also clear that humanity
does not have an answer.

2132
02:03:29,945 --> 02:03:33,337
There are questions to which humanity has no answer.

2133
02:03:33,572 --> 02:03:38,148
When and where should be the limit
of freedom of speech?

2134
02:03:38,172 --> 02:03:41,402
By groping, like this.

2135
02:03:41,557 --> 02:03:43,659
Self-regulation at the editorial level?

2136
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:46,428
There can be no self-regulation.

2137
02:03:46,452 --> 02:03:50,017
There are journalists
in Ukraine, but there is no journalism.

2138
02:03:50,732 --> 02:03:55,588
Because this is the main question.

2139
02:03:55,612 --> 02:04:03,005
You know, the principles of the workshop
are what civil society is all about.

2140
02:04:03,525 --> 02:04:06,668
If we don't tell doctors

2141
02:04:06,693 --> 02:04:08,144
that they are treating badly,

2142
02:04:08,176 --> 02:04:13,631
the doctors will say among themselves that
it's not our.

2143
02:04:13,655 --> 02:04:17,091
He violates ethics, so we decide.

2144
02:04:17,392 --> 02:04:20,429
Lawyers say it's not ours,

2145
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:26,595
engineers say it's not ours, journalists say, no,
no, it's not a journalist, it's something else.

2146
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:35,076
And then civil society emerges,
a society consisting of different communities.

2147
02:04:35,536 --> 02:04:37,708
Well, in addition to citizens,
there are also communities.

2148
02:04:37,732 --> 02:04:44,601
Philatelists say that he collects fake
stamps, he collects the wrong ones. And so on.

2149
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,914
Without self-regulation,
nothing will happen,

2150
02:04:46,938 --> 02:04:53,149
and we cannot have self-regulation.
I did this in the 90s, as it is called...

2151
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:56,588
we created a commission
on journalistic ethics

2152
02:04:56,612 --> 02:05:07,200
with the late Mostovyi. And with
Krivenko how many times we... this Ukraine.

2153
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:13,452
Western colleagues gave us money
 to explain journalism to judges.

2154
02:05:13,746 --> 02:05:17,868
To explain to journalists
how and where the trial.

2155
02:05:17,892 --> 02:05:22,714
With prosecutors, with
governors, oh my God.

2156
02:05:23,429 --> 02:05:28,388
There's nothing. At the moment
when self-organization begins,

2157
02:05:28,412 --> 02:05:35,032
when journalists suddenly say among
themselves, this is not a journalist.

2158
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:38,308
It's not the Minister decision

2159
02:05:38,332 --> 02:05:42,668
and not a policeman's, but we
decided somewhere gathered and said

2160
02:05:42,692 --> 02:05:46,092
that this is not a journalist. At
that moment everything began.

2161
02:05:46,116 --> 02:05:50,988
Just as doctors say this is a bad doctor,
we do not take him to our workshop,

2162
02:05:51,012 --> 02:05:55,182
he does not know how to treat
people. And so on and so forth.

2163
02:05:55,262 --> 02:05:59,188
It turns out that for more than
30 years of independence

2164
02:05:59,212 --> 02:06:01,690
in Ukraine journalistic
workshop has not formed.

2165
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:08,268
I think you know the
answer to that question.

2166
02:06:08,292 --> 02:06:12,309
It is obvious, but I would
give another example here.

2167
02:06:13,437 --> 02:06:22,188
In 1776, America became
a supposedly free country,

2168
02:06:22,212 --> 02:06:24,948
then they adopted a
constitution where that says,

2169
02:06:24,972 --> 02:06:33,228
all people are born free and
have the right to fight for happiness.

2170
02:06:35,353 --> 02:06:46,041
About 100 years passed when they 
said that blacks were also people.

2171
02:06:48,453 --> 02:06:52,977
And then another 120 years passed 
and a black president was elected

2172
02:06:54,659 --> 02:07:02,498
Therefore, it takes about 200 years for
something to change. And 30 is just nothing.

2173
02:07:02,562 --> 02:07:06,028
Good evening, my name
is Anna and I am a student.

2174
02:07:06,052 --> 02:07:14,752
I heard what you said, the Russian language, it
will be, and as if there is no point in fighting it.

2175
02:07:14,809 --> 02:07:22,649
Although I study journalism and think that
many young people would disagree with you.

2176
02:07:22,753 --> 02:07:25,828
This must be fought and

2177
02:07:25,852 --> 02:07:29,729
where do you get such
despondency, or are you just a realist?

2178
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,428
Listen, I don't mind, fight.

2179
02:07:34,452 --> 02:07:38,820
Did I tell you not to fight you? Fight.

2180
02:07:40,193 --> 02:07:43,748
You know, there was one
such American president

2181
02:07:43,772 --> 02:07:47,937
who quoted another Ukrainian
writer 'Fight and you`ll succeed'.

2182
02:07:50,963 --> 02:07:52,243
If you know how.

2183
02:07:52,329 --> 02:07:55,341
Yes, so there are no questions,

2184
02:07:55,365 --> 02:07:58,376
and only students
would disagree and that's fine, I'm happy.

2185
02:07:59,789 --> 02:08:09,373
I remember in 1990 the first senators came to Kyiv.

2186
02:08:10,969 --> 02:08:16,443
I do not remember, it was nuclear weapons, Lugar there.

2187
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,927
They came and we talked 
about something there.

2188
02:08:21,729 --> 02:08:29,498
Well, I'm as sharp as a setro, I say 
it badly, it's bad, it's bad.

2189
02:08:30,213 --> 02:08:33,508
And then the general speeches.

2190
02:08:33,532 --> 02:08:38,213
The senator says how cool it
is now in the former Soviet Union,

2191
02:08:38,238 --> 02:08:43,934
in the Ukrainian SSR, although we know that
it wants to become Ukraine without the USSR.

2192
02:08:44,268 --> 02:08:46,668
How cool that there is freedom of speech.

2193
02:08:46,692 --> 02:08:49,410
It was hard for me to imagine that a young,...

2194
02:08:49,435 --> 02:08:52,302
I was young then, I was not always like now, ...

2195
02:08:52,593 --> 02:08:56,228
a journalist and began to criticize.

2196
02:08:56,252 --> 02:08:59,101
It is impossible to imagine two years ago

2197
02:08:59,125 --> 02:09:02,093
someone will start
criticizing. So congratulations.

2198
02:09:02,207 --> 02:09:04,036
And I'm like, here you are...

2199
02:09:04,060 --> 02:09:09,246
Well, I just complain to him,
and he says, oh, that's freedom.

2200
02:09:10,048 --> 02:09:12,348
So you know, you fight.

2201
02:09:12,372 --> 02:09:16,028
I just know that you cannot eradicate what

2202
02:09:16,052 --> 02:09:25,559
has been imposed for
centuries, not years, not decades.

2203
02:09:26,949 --> 02:09:30,464
Not if you know where the secret 
toggle switch is.

2204
02:09:30,496 --> 02:09:35,467
I always look for it, where there is this magic
toggle switch where it is written on and off.

2205
02:09:35,492 --> 02:09:39,647
And secondly, this is quite relevant now.

2206
02:09:39,703 --> 02:09:46,988
I just look, there is
such a Lviv lady Farion.

2207
02:09:47,012 --> 02:09:54,888
And here is such a delicate moment
what you want.

2208
02:09:55,789 --> 02:10:00,188
If you want to have a lot of
Ukrainian and little Russian

2209
02:10:00,212 --> 02:10:03,789
or extreme that there
was no Russian at all,

2210
02:10:04,694 --> 02:10:09,108
then you will not achieve the goal if
you say

2211
02:10:09,132 --> 02:10:13,012
Hey you, assholes, why do you speak in Russian?

2212
02:10:13,037 --> 02:10:14,717
It definitely won't come.

2213
02:10:15,323 --> 02:10:16,984
But if you say,

2214
02:10:17,008 --> 02:10:25,759
I understand these people, I understand
the age of prohibitions. I understand it.

2215
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:30,828
I propose, let's create
teachers on the front

2216
02:10:30,852 --> 02:10:35,142
who will go if anyone
wants any consultations.

2217
02:10:35,166 --> 02:10:39,205
We will help, we understand
you, we want to help.

2218
02:10:39,235 --> 02:10:44,508
Then maybe such people will be
found and there will be more results.

2219
02:10:44,532 --> 02:10:46,670
And when you say, hey you assholes...

2220
02:10:46,731 --> 02:10:50,308
You know what I like,

2221
02:10:50,332 --> 02:10:57,659
thank God I'm not on social networks,
but when I read the news, I read reviews.

2222
02:10:57,890 --> 02:11:04,572
Well, 90% of the reviews in
 some media - Yermak is terrible.

2223
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:14,866
I say, if we imagine the need to defeat
Russia, then it seems to me that it comes first.

2224
02:11:17,665 --> 02:11:20,450
They write there, he must 
be shot immediately.

2225
02:11:20,474 --> 02:11:25,828
I say maybe let's offer
him... If I am convinced

2226
02:11:25,852 --> 02:11:31,983
that after Yermak is gone and

2227
02:11:32,007 --> 02:11:33,888
there will be a Ukrainian flag over the
Kremlin,

2228
02:11:33,912 --> 02:11:35,882
I will be the first to go to the Maidan.

2229
02:11:35,907 --> 02:11:38,733
Moreover, I had a suspicion
that Yermak himself would say

2230
02:11:38,757 --> 02:11:42,227
that I would shoot myself in front of you
for the victory of Ukraine.

2231
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:47,205
I am ready to shoot myself right on
Independence Square, you will see my  corpse.

2232
02:11:48,404 --> 02:11:53,070
But what will we do if our flag does
not loom over the Kremlin in this case?

2233
02:11:53,095 --> 02:11:54,173
In extreme cases, we apologize.

2234
02:11:54,198 --> 02:11:55,198
Yeah, yeah.

2235
02:11:55,610 --> 02:12:00,774
So I always say, if you want to
know the language - be friendly.

2236
02:12:00,798 --> 02:12:03,428
You will not learn the
language with swear words

2237
02:12:03,452 --> 02:12:05,300
and questions about why they
do not speak Russian.

2238
02:12:05,817 --> 02:12:11,300
After such words, it is unlikely that anyone
will want to learn the Ukrainian language.

2239
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:16,960
And if you gradually learn...
As Sadovyi said, but with good.

2240
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,372
Once we interviewed him.

2241
02:12:18,397 --> 02:12:20,397
With love, he said, but with love.

2242
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,960
Look, no, not yelling, not shouting.

2243
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:27,960
But you just said that, like, no, it will be Russian.

2244
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,960
And you can't do anything about it,
you have to come to terms with it.

2245
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:33,960
So I'm not ready to come to terms with it.

2246
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:36,960
That is, you still need to do some actions.

2247
02:12:37,429 --> 02:12:39,960
For example, let's be specific.

2248
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,350
Some are not suitable here.

2249
02:12:41,375 --> 02:12:42,911
Let's be specific.

2250
02:12:42,936 --> 02:12:45,578
One, two, three, four, twelve.

2251
02:12:45,603 --> 02:12:49,935
Well, to start what they are doing now, to target people.

2252
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:52,960
And this is very abstract. What is targetting? How?

2253
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,960
How to target?

2254
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:55,960
Through content.

2255
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:56,960
Through what?

2256
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:57,960
Through content.

2257
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:58,960
What is content?

2258
02:12:58,960 --> 02:12:59,960
Even on YouTube.

2259
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:01,960
Let's speak a language that everyone understands.

2260
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:04,488
What is content and what is targetting?

2261
02:13:04,513 --> 02:13:06,513
It's the same as spirituality.

2262
02:13:06,538 --> 02:13:08,935
I love people very much who say, we need spirituality.

2263
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:11,960
Let me touch the spirituality.

2264
02:13:12,484 --> 02:13:13,960
Let me, I want to watch.

2265
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:17,302
Let me have content and target.

2266
02:13:17,611 --> 02:13:18,960
No, well, content is a filling.

2267
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:19,960
Your division.

2268
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:20,960
That's right.

2269
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:21,960
On TV.

2270
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:22,960
Now content.

2271
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:23,960
Already on TV.

2272
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:24,960
What's next?

2273
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:25,960
What else?

2274
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:26,960
YouTube.

2275
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:27,960
There is no Russian language.

2276
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:28,960
Next what?

2277
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,960
How are we going to target?

2278
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:30,960
No, no.

2279
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:31,960
You know.

2280
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:32,960
No, I don't know.

2281
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,960
There are many, even Ukrainian bloggers.

2282
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:35,960
Very famous.

2283
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:36,960
Influencers.

2284
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:37,960
Yes.

2285
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:39,960
There are still those who speak Russian.

2286
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:40,960
Yes.

2287
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,960
And they say, like, it's generally cool.

2288
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:43,960
It's normal.

2289
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:44,960
Yes.

2290
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:45,960
Here I am against such.

2291
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:46,960
I am also against it.

2292
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:48,960
I have a proposition for you.

2293
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:51,960
Only I will personally give you a gun.

2294
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,960
So that you kill them.

2295
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:55,960
Only with your own hands, please.

2296
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:58,960
Not abstract to target.

2297
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:01,935
And just take aim.

2298
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:03,766
And press.

2299
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:07,960
Listen.

2300
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:08,960
Well, this is from the 90s.

2301
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:10,935
Discussion, ideas, ideas.

2302
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:16,679
It means that you, Anya, should become so bright
that your brightness will push those bloggers

2303
02:14:16,704 --> 02:14:19,189
who you are not satisfied with, out of this blogosphere.

2304
02:14:19,214 --> 02:14:22,908
You have to overcome them. People have to follow you.

2305
02:14:23,197 --> 02:14:26,420
Then what you say will become a reality.

2306
02:14:26,602 --> 02:14:30,560
There is another way, as Mr. Mykola says. These are years.

2307
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:33,960
And the number of such people will be less and less.

2308
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,960
Our identity will become more and more.

2309
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:38,038
And if the world changes

2310
02:14:38,062 --> 02:14:42,960
and this world redesigning will
take place, it will possibly happen.

2311
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,520
We don't know that.

2312
02:14:44,545 --> 02:14:45,960
We are modern people.

2313
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:50,037
Perhaps the set of languages will be narrowed altogether.

2314
02:14:50,062 --> 02:14:55,014
It will be Spanish, English, and Chinese, for example.

2315
02:14:55,039 --> 02:15:01,149
Depending on how this ball changes.

2316
02:15:01,174 --> 02:15:08,856
We don't know anything. Because we have one idiot who
 can launch a nuclear weapon at any time, you know,

2317
02:15:08,881 --> 02:15:16,415
and wash away one-sixth of the world,
which also speaks some language. No one knows.

2318
02:15:18,764 --> 02:15:27,960
More specifics, dear lady. This is not
a discussion. Aiming at content is nothing.

2319
02:15:29,782 --> 02:15:31,908
For the first time,

2320
02:15:31,933 --> 02:15:35,681
the Palace of Ukraine. Well, because
only today is Independence Day,

2321
02:15:35,705 --> 02:15:37,961
there was still such a
movement, well, as it were.

2322
02:15:39,465 --> 02:15:44,988
And there is in the basement,
well, under everything there,

2323
02:15:45,012 --> 02:15:47,960
they covered the tables, and
there would be some kind of cafe.

2324
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:51,149
Not the cafe that we
all go to, but there it is.

2325
02:15:51,174 --> 02:15:53,960
And there is something like that.
And we are sitting with Naboka.

2326
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:58,715
Naboka served in prison, as a dissident.

2327
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:05,960
And we are sitting. And Naboka
had such an idea that let's drink champagne.

2328
02:16:06,623 --> 02:16:10,330
He decided that we needed to stop drinking, so let's have champagne.

2329
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,253
Well, okay. And we drink champagne.

2330
02:16:14,277 --> 02:16:18,960
And so, I wouldn't say that we
drank a lot, really, there was one glass.

2331
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:24,228
And Naboka is like this. Do you 
know what I want to tell you?

2332
02:16:25,522 --> 02:16:27,738
That the people are fools.

2333
02:16:28,678 --> 02:16:32,908
And here, next to them, there
are such women, such Rukhivs,

2334
02:16:32,932 --> 02:16:36,960
such in handkerchiefs,
such real Ukrainians.

2335
02:16:37,893 --> 02:16:42,960
And they are like this, Mr. Sergei, 
how can you say that?

2336
02:16:43,901 --> 02:16:47,960
You were in prison for the people. 
You suffered for the people.

Mr. Sergei is sitting like this.

2338
02:16:49,915 --> 02:16:53,960
That's why I was in prison and
suffering, that the people are fools.

2339
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:01,960
I would be sentenced for this,
 and I would be shot here.

2340
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:05,118
And Naboka, you know, five years
in prison

2341
02:17:05,142 --> 02:17:09,585
for nationalism, somehow he was like this.

2342
02:17:09,610 --> 02:17:11,610
And they just silently left.

2343
02:17:11,635 --> 02:17:15,935
And if I had been sitting, they 
would have already buried me there.

2344
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:17,228
Thank you very much.
